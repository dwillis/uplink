            "full_text": "Two weeks after a freak storm dropped more than 15 inches of rain on San Antonio, more than 100 residents from a flood-ravaged neighborhood gathered in an elementary school gym. They wanted to know why the government, at any level, had not told them they were at risk of flooding... The path of the destruction closely followed the 100-year flood plains published in 1996. In fact, 75 percent of the 175 residences destroyed by the flood were in those flood plains. Citywide, only about 10 percent of the damaged buildings were insured by the National Flood Insurance Program, which meant 90 percent of the people in 470 damaged buildings were trying to rebuild on slim federal grants or disaster loans they could not afford to repay."

PI was the brainchild of IRE members from both sides of the border and it extends IRE's programs... We trust that these and other problems will become the exception as Latin American journalism develops more savvy reporters and, of course, readers. Also helpful will be the expanding network of CAR pioneers who, as they refine their methodologies, can share their wisdom with newcomers."
