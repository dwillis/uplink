            "full_text": "While covering the case of a Washington state ferry boat captain accused of sexual harassment, News Tribune courts reporter Cynthia Flash began hearing stories of other lawsuits pending against the state. She wondered how many. With the help of a computer, she found out. There were thousands, many thousands, not just for sexual harassment but also for illegal rectal probes of prison inmates and for people killed and maimed because of wrongful conduct and neglect by state employees. An analysis of computerized state records led to a three-day series that revealed for the first time that state taxpayers were paying a heavy price for the negligence and misconduct of state employees - more than $76 million in settlements in less than a decade. The annual average was $9 million. Although ranking only 18th in population, the state was paying more per capita in liability damage awards than any other state in the contiguous United States. The series was the first major computer-assisted project at The (Tacoma, Wash.) Morning News Tribune and, as this piece is written, its findings are reverberating in the campaign to elect a new attorney general. Aside from that impact, its success underscored the fact that time-tested techniques of investigative reporting - specifically, following the paper trail - should be an integral part of computer-assisted reporting. Following the paper trail and using your noggin to figure out where documentation can be found are vital. The big difference is that, in these times, the indexes to the records, if not the records themselves, are kept on computer. In this project, the computer data led the way to the paper trail. While there is a tendency to measure computer-assisted projects by the number of megabytes in the database you're crunching, don't be afraid to think small. In Washington state, many obscure public agencies have their own little fiefdoms. Instead of storing data on a state mega-computer, they tend to keep their records on PCs. The whole database you're after may fit on a few diskettes. Something I learned in two decades of following paper trails: Read the applicable state laws before you get too far into your investigation. Become knowledgeable about how the system is supposed to operate. That's what I did when I was asked to do the computer work for Flash's investigation. The risk management statutes yielded a quick dividend; I found that the risk management agency was required, by law, to maintain a computerized tracking system of all claims filed against the state. The trouble was this computerized tracking system was, by law, confidential. However, the same law held that claims filed against the state were public records, available for inspection. Our strategy: Press for release of the data that was public, even though it was on a \"confidential\" database. When Flash made her first visit to the agency, she was offered a voluminous printout containing the key information of the public claims data kept on the computer. Altogether, there were some 25,000 cases. The printed data was so diffused, so overwhelming, that it was virtually unusable. We needed the computer data in order to make sense of anything. I made a public records request for the computer data, specifically the portion from the hard copy claims the state law said was public record. Nothing like that had happened before at the risk management agency. The director sent the request to the attorney general's office for a legal opinion. It took six weeks to get an answer. Finally, we got word that our request had been approved; we would be given the computer data for all closed cases, some 20,000 of them, together with the type of case - civil rights, wrongful death, personal injury, etc. (Later, we got an additional 5,000 records of open cases.) Using XDB, I began breaking down the claims data for each department, year by year. The worst record, finally instituted a training program for employees. But the series also showed that some state agencies simply kept doing things the same as ever, despite the fact that their mistakes were costing the taxpayer millions of dollars. Flash found a 1978 case in which an auto plunged off an icy bridge, killing the driver. A Department of Transportation engineer recommended installing a $22,000 guard rail. Nothing was done. Five years later, another driver plunged off the bridge during a rainstorm, falling 40 feet to the gully below. The victim suffered a head injury that caused paralysis, memory loss, and emotional problems. Less than a year later, a third car slammed into a bridge girder during a heavy rainstorm. The driver suffered a broken back. The last two victims sued the state and won nearly $1.8 million. And the bridge? It still isn't fixed. The Department of Corrections, which operates the state's penal institutions, turned out to be a major trouble spot. One series of cases involved a convicted rapist who was released from the sexual psychopath program at a state mental hospital. Over the next three years before he was caught, the rapist brutalized 26 Tacoma-area women. So far, the state has paid some $640,000 for its mistake in releasing the rapist, settling lawsuits brought by 18 of the victims. And the total is climbing as more victims sue. Flash also unearthed the existence of \"Dr. Bigfinger,\" the practice at state prisons of performing body cavity searches on all inmates admitted to the maximum security units. Prison officials maintained the body cavity search policy was necessary to keep the prisons free from drugs, knives, and rapes. The inmates, however, charged that the rectal searches amounted to rape. In 1987, a federal judge ruled the policy unconstitutional, finding that prison officials used the policy for punitive, rather than safety reasons. The state stopped the \"Dr. Bigfinger\" practice when the first lawsuits were filed. But the issue of whether damages should be awarded to the inmates is being appealed by the state. So far, the illegal searches have cost the state $194,528. The state has paid 65 inmates $200 to $500 for each search. Some cases are still pending. Flash emerged from the project as a believer in computer-assisted reporting. \"The computer pointed the way,\" she said."

            "full_text": "Pending legislation could make electronically stored government data more accessible to the public. During the last session of Congress, the House Administration Committee approved the Government Printing Office (GPO) Electronic Information Access Enhancement Act of 1992. The bill would require the GPO to provide online public access to the Federal Register, the Congressional Record and a directory of federal information. The bill would also provide for online access to some publications under the control of the superintendent of documents and other departments. The legislation is a boon for reporters. Online access would make it easier and less expensive to retrieve and use government information. \"The bill would particularly help small news organizations by making available some of the things that can only be accessed through tapes now,\" said Penny Loeb, an investigative reporter for New York Newsday and a member of the board of directors of Investigative Reporters and Editors. \"It would make it possible, for example, to go online cheaply and get background on a specific issue, like hazardous waste. It opens up a whole avenue of opportunity,\" she said. Loeb testified on the bill at the hearings. The bill is the brainchild of the Taxpayer Assets Project and the American Library Association, and the result of the efforts of numerous organizations including the American Society of Journalists and Authors, Project Censored, and the Coalition of Networked Information. James Love, director of the Taxpayer Assets Project, anticipates congressional approval, but not of the legislation he originally sought. \"It's more a matter of how good a bill we'll get, not if we'll get a bill,\" Love said. Rep. Charlie Rose (D-N.C.) and Vice President-elect Albert Gore sponsored the original legislation, commonly called the GPO Gateway/WINDOWS bills. But somewhere between their initial proposals and the revised House-approved version, lobbyists for commercial data vendors convinced Republican members of the House Administration Committee to narrow the scope of the legislation. The most significant exclusion in the revised bill is funding, Love said. The original bills suggested appropriating $3 million this year and $10 million next year for the development of online databases. The revised bill doesn't offer any appropriations. The new bill also limits the range of online information. The Gateway/WINDOWS bills sought an array of online databases, including the federal LEGIS and JURIS systems, the SEC's EDGAR system, MEDLINE, and the FDA Bulletin Board. The revised bill only mandates that the Federal Register, the Congressional Record and the federal information directory go online. The original bills provided for online access through mainframe networks like Internet and through federal depository libraries. The revised bill abandoned mandatory network access in favor of a study of Internet access. The new bill still allows for free access for 1,400 federal depository libraries and will charge all other users the cost of dissemination only. Fees should be significantly less expensive than those charged by private data vendors. Love said that Rep. Rose and other members of Congress have promised to give the bill priority next session. Despite the limitations of the revised bill, the legislation would provide the public with government information for which taxpayers continually pay but can rarely access. \"We should all push to make it better,\" Loeb said. \"Even though it's a small step, it's something.\""
