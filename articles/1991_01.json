    "full_text": "When New York Newsday reporter Penny Loeb called Aly Dadras to tell him that the city owed him at least $5,000, Dadras reacted with disbelief. Several months earlier, the New York City Department of Finance had told Dadras it was preparing to take over a house he owns in Queens for nonpayment of taxes. For Dadras, an architect and professor at the New York University Institute of Technology, who pays close attention to his bills, the Finance Department's proceedings had been a great shock. Loeb's computer analysis of city finance records showed that the city owed him money, as well as hundreds of thousands of others, amounting to as much as $275 million in overpayments on their real estate, water, and sewer taxes. Newsday reported this on its front page on January 7. While Dadras now awaits a refund, and the city has stopped pursuing his property, the city continues to sort out the situation slowly. It is estimated to take a month to reorganize records. Loeb discovered this story when analyzing credits owed to property owners using a computer tape obtained from the Finance Department for $225 under the New York State Freedom of Information Law. The tape contained nearly 1.5 million records detailing credits owed for real estate, sewer, or water. Loeb identified over 500,000 records for analysis using NineTrack Express and XDB. Her findings were surprising not for the bureaucratic blunder but for how quickly and effectively the personal computer enabled her to uncover the story."
