            "full_text": "I knew the wind farms of Northern California were killing birds in their giant blades. I knew it was enough of a problem that researchers were spending big bucks on studies designed to explain the avian deaths and find ways to reduce the mortality. What I didn't know was how many birds the turbines chewed up, nor did I have a break down of the kinds of species affected. I also did not know exactly how the birds died.\n\nSix months later\n\nAfter a six-month investigation and a computer analysis of mortality reports, I had my answers - and my readers did, too. On May 14, 1995, the Contra Costa Times reported that about 8,900 turbines in the hills east of San Francisco had killed or injured 679 birds over a period of three years and one month. Most were birds of prey.\n\nThe death toll included 266 red-tailed hawks, 64 golden eagles, 48 barn owls, and 34 American kestrels. None of these are protected by state or federal endangered species laws, but all are by other federal laws.\n\nThe government can fine companies and individuals thousands of dollars if they kill golden eagles or other migratory birds under the Bald Eagle Protection Act or the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.\n\nThe computer analysis also revealed that the deaths were on the increase. The wind farms killed 10 golden eagles, for example, in 1992, 23 the following year and 28 in 1994. The toll on red-tailed hawks climbed from 40 in 1992 to 164 in 1994. These numbers, however, were only a small part of the three-story package that began on the cover and filled most of two inside pages. The main story explored a deep rift in California's sizable environmental community over the issue. After all, wind energy is clean energy. It produces no greenhouse gases, which many scientists blame for causing global warming.\n\nIt also detailed industry and government efforts to curb the deaths and revealed that there had been no prosecutions. Persuading a jury that the companies were intentionally violating the law would be difficult, a former federal prosecutor told me.\n\nThe second story documented how wind energy, once a booming affair in California, was facing an uncertain future due to land-use conflicts, the loss of subsidies and changing politics. Elsewhere in the United States, and in other countries, wind farms are expanding.\n\nThe third story was a short sidebar on a proposed new Bay Area wind farm.\n\nIt all started with a tip from a source who said he had heard that golden eagle deaths were increasing. I called the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and asked for mortality statistics, but was quickly rebuffed. They said the records were part of an ongoing criminal investigation, so I couldn't have them.\n\n'No' is not an answer\n\nInstead of filing a lawsuit, I followed another lead and found the records, or at least many of them. Companies operating wind farms in the region have to report mortality data to the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nIn Alameda County, thanks to a planning commission requirement, they must also submit the reports to the county planning department. The largest company, Kenentech, which has since filed for bankruptcy protection, also reported mortality data for neighboring Contra Costa Solano counties to Alameda County.\n\nHad Contra Costa and Solano counties also required companies to report mortality incidents, my numbers would have no doubt been higher. Those counties told me they weren't in the business of regulating wildlife.\n\nThe records came in two formats. One was a list that itemized each death or injury and included the date of the incident, species of bird, type of injury and location. The other was a sheet of paper that included the same information for each incident.\n\nNotes on the data also included written descriptions of how the birds died. \"It was these notes that impressed me, the descriptions of just how badly these birds were being mutilated, and the fact that the birds had no awareness of the danger they were about to face,\" said Project Editor Gene Williams.\n\nBuilding the database\n\nContra Costa Times computer guru Morgan Cartwright used Visual Basic to design a front-end program that allowed easy data entry. To make sure we entered the data in a consistent fashion, he designed a series of scrolling list boxes. One list, for example, contained all the different kinds of birds. Another was the location of the incident. One more provided choices for different kinds of injuries.\n\nCartwright chose the database program Microsoft Access to use on our IBM-clone 486 computer to manage and manipulate the data.\n\nIt took a temp worker and myself three days to enter the data. Once the data was in, the numbers were extremely simple to calculate.\n\nAfter we crunched the numbers, I presented them to a variety of sources including the Fish and Wildlife Service, which had refused to share their information. Were we on target? No one objected.\n\nWe presented the numbers in roughly four paragraphs in the main bar and in a front-page graphic that also included the location of the turbines and energy trade-offs between wind and other sources.\n\nTips\n\nIf one government source won't give you the data you need, don't give up. Look for other agencies that might have the same information.\n\nBalance and juggle. Though I worked on this project for more than six months, I still produced regular daily stories. I'd try to devote one day a week to the birds. Once I was ready to write, I persuaded my editors to give me two weeks to complete the project.\n\nSee what others have written on the subject. A Nexis search turned up wind farm articles from around the globe.\n\nCheck your results. Run them by a variety of experts and see what they think.\n\nJames Bruggers can be reached at (510) 935-2525, or send e-mail to ecowriter@aol.com."

            "full_text": "There's a new kid in the www.reporter.org neighborhood: The Society of Environmental Journalists. SEJ moved to the IRE/NICAR server this fall as the first step in an ambitious upgrade for SEJ's online services.\n\nAs an SEJ board member and manager of its Web page, I'm excited about the move and the plans we have for new services to our members. Best of all, except as noted, all of the services we have are open to non-members as well.\n\nWe especially encourage Uplink readers and IRE members to take advantage of what we've been putting together. We hope to create a one-stop site for information about and Internet resources of use in environmental journalism. We're not quite to that point, but once we've settled into our new digs, the upgrades will be coming fast and furious.\n\nMore documents\n\nThe centerpiece is our Web page, at http:// www.sej.org. Begun two years ago on space donated by the Tacoma (Wash.) News Tribune, our page has two types of resources. First, it has a rapidly growing collection of documents created by SEJ and related groups: Our quarterly SEJournal, with back issues to Spring 1995 and more being added steadily; the biweekly TipSheet, a guide to upcoming environmental news from SEJ, the National Safety Council's Environmental Health Center and the Radio and Television News Directors Association; and other publications. Our near-term plans include several new projects, such as \"Frequently Asked Questions\" files on environmental topics.\n\nPertinent hot links\n\nSecond, the SEJ Web page also contains a well-edited collection of links to other Internet sites that we believe are not just useful to environmental journalists, but also reliable. Some of these sites are featured in On the Internet on page six of this issue. Additional sites are added as they are brought to our attention. Our intent with these listings is to separate the wheat from the chaff, and focus on sites that either a) contain good, solid content, or b) have encyclopedic collections of links to other sites on the subject.\n\nSearch engine added\n\nWith our move to reporter.org we'll be adding one new feature that our members have requested many times: A search engine. Now, visitors to the Web page will be able to search by keyword for, say, an unfamiliar chemical that they have to write about on deadline, or a new subject - electromagnetic fields, for example that they need to learn about in a hurry.\n\nThe Web page also contains information about how to join SEJ and regular updates on our national and regional conferences, many of which attract non-members as well. For example, on Sept. 7, we brought 80 people to Stanford University for an all-day conference on computer-assisted reporting and the Internet, an event co-organized by the Northern California Science Writers Association and sponsored in part by NICAR.\n\nWe've also posted frequent agenda updates for our 1996 national conference Oct. 17-20 in St. Louis, and as plans come together for our next national conference in Tucson Oct. 2-5, 1997, and the one after that in Chattanooga, Tenn., in 1998, we'll be posting updates on the Web site. The same is true for activities of our sister organization, the International Federation of Environmental Journalists. On the SEJ Web page, you'll find the IFEJ newsletter and a summary of plans for that group's annual conference in November in the Philippines.\n\nNew listservs\n\nThe Web page isn't the only thing we're doing at the sej.org domain. We're also creating several new listservs to supplement our existing, members-only list. At least one of these will be a general discussion list for environmental journalism, open to members and non-members alike. And in imitation of nicar.org, we also plan to create our own newsgroups for whatever purposes appropriate-looking for roommates at an upcoming conference, posting press releases and other announcements, and so forth.\n\nWe're grateful to NICAR for making room for us on its server, and to the Tacoma News Tribune for having given us a home during our formative period. We hope you'll visit the Web page at http://www.sej.org and let us know how you think it could be improved.\n\nRussell Clemings can be reached at (209) 441-6371, or send e-mail to clemings@cris.com."

            "headline": "Toxic Release Inventory - What toxins are wafting your way?",
            "author_name": "Greg Reeves",
            "author_title": "The Kansas City Star",
            "full_text": "For a high-impact story using one of the most interesting databases around, take a look at the Toxic Release Inventory data from the Environmental Protection Agency. Company by company, across the nation, you can produce fascinating reports on the toxic pollutants that waft into our air, float down our rivers, are dumped in a landfill or- the way some toxins are removed-are shot a mile underground.\n\nGood for beginners\n\nIf you are a beginner at computer-assisted reporting with no more than a spreadsheet at hand, the TRI database would be an excellent entry point-it's cheap, clean data with lots of public interest. If you've thrown around a few gigabytes, you can generate great maps offering a detailed portrait of pollution in your community, neighborhood by neighborhood.\n\nSince 1987, federal law has required companies to report \"toxic releases\" to the EPA. They must report what chemicals were involved and what amounts (in pounds) ended up in the air, land, water, sewer or storage site. Each chemical emission is a separate report. And each report becomes a record in the TRI. The easiest way to get the data you want is probably a call to your local EPA office, state environmental office, or NICAR. Various Web sites also offer some TRI data. TRI data is not harmful to your computing environment. The files are roughly one megabyte per state per year. Missouri data, for example, contained 1,845 records for 1994 and fit neatly on one diskette. That included mid-Missouri lead smelter country, where lead emissions in some places total nearly 12 tons per child.\n\nWhat's in the data\n\nThere are 38 fields in the TRI database, and by now you are surely hungry to know them. Basically half the fields identify the \"facility,\" or company site, and the other half identify the chemical and where it went.\n\nFor each facility you get: an ID number, name, street address, city, state and zip; parent company (if any) and contact name and phone; and, for map-making purposes, the latitude and longitude of the facility.\n\nFor each chemical you get an English name (acetone, styrene, zinc, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, etc.), and a unique identifying code from the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) registry. Use the CAS number rather than the chemical name to sort and group data. For each release, you get: how much went up a smokestack (\"stack\" air); how much just drifted away (\"fugitive\" air); and how much went into the water, in the ground, to sewers or to offsite recycling plants. Finally, each record contains one or more industry codes and federal ID numbers to help identify the facility.\n\nHow to use it\n\nOne of the best uses you can make of the TRI data is to report how pollution has changed in your community over the past eight years. Have the worst companies from the 1980s cleaned themselves up? In FoxPro, you might want to find the biggest overall polluters first:\n\nSELECT facility, SUM (alw) FROM tri; GROUP BY 1; ORDER BY 3 DESC\n\nThe first field, tri_id, is the facility ID number mentioned above. The \"alw\" field (\"air-land-water\") is the sum of stack-air, fugitive-air, land emissions and water emissions. Another handy add-up is stack-air plus fugitive-air, which equals total air pollution.\n\nThis query will give you a company name at the top and some huge number of pounds-emitted. Take the first 10 or so companies and see how they've fared since 1987:\n\nSELECT tri id, year, facility, SUM(alw); FROM tri; WHERE INLIST (tri id \"1st tri_id\", \"2nd tri id...\"); GROUP BY 1, 2 ORDER BY 1,2,3 DESC\n\nYou're on your way to a story that people need to know. And there's much more. Maps bring out TRI's impact in vivid clarity: per capita toxic waste, the most polluted ZIP code, the center of zinc toxicity in your community.\n\nOther important ways to look at TRI data include limiting your queries to include only known cancer-causing chemicals and known \"reproductive toxins\" - chemicals that damage reproductive organs.\n\nTo do that in FoxPro, make a table out of a list of CAS numbers of all the known carcinogens. Then match those numbers against the CAS numbers in the TRI database, something like this:\n\nSELECT cancer.*, chemical, any-other-fields; FROM cancer, tri; WHERE tri.cas_no = cancer.cas\n\nThen do the same thing with reproductive toxins, making a FoxPro table out of a list of their CAS numbers.\n\nGreg Reeves can be reached at (816) 234-4366, or send e-mail to greeves@kcstar.com."
