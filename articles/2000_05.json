In CAR's case, knowing what data are available, how to analyze it, whom to call to verify it is crucial. CAR stories add context, turning simple stories into invaluable reports. Examples include analyzing FDA's 'Children & Tobacco Compliance Checker' database to measure state compliance levels and using FOIA requests for tobacco enforcement engagement. Other features were made possible by practice and preparedness, like election precinct analyses or tracking gas prices, all aiding the process of consistent quality."

It was found that nearly 3,000 school employees had criminal records, including felony convictions. The system heavily relied on applicants to self-disclose past convictions. Using databases sourced from state departments and a comprehensive analysis over a 26-hour stretch, the report exposed these oversights. Schools planned to improve monitoring and close loopholes in light of the findings, which shocked parents and state officials."
