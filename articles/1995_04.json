Schools and colleges use data to track spending, and meet state and federal reporting requirements. At U.S. News, we have documented school segregation, inequities in a key federal grant program, and the rundown condition of school buildings. Computerized records were vital to our Dec. 13, 1993 cover story \"Separate and Unequal,\" documenting how special education programs are segregated, rife with misspending, and harming children. The basic data for \"Separate and Unequal\" was the survey of racial makeup of schools, done every two years by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights. It encompasses districts with more than 25,000 students, and a random sample of about a third of the smaller districts. The most recent data is for 1992. Historical data goes back to 1968. The survey includes the number of students by race and gender by school. It also has a racial breakdown for those in special education, gifted programs, and those receiving corporal punishment. Journalists should get the additional documentation for the survey, which shows what data is missing. There are some major omissions and quirks. We supplemented this data with state records. Connecticut, for instance, includes many more details. We used this data to show that black kids are more likely to be in special education than white kids. It also showed that black kids are more likely to be labeled mentally retarded, while white kids get the less stigmatizing label of learning disabled. We found tremendous variation in the type of education for these students. Some are included in regular classrooms, others spend all day in separate classrooms, which makes them feel inferior. We also examined the high cost. Early research shows reimbursement formulas often influence the number of children in special education. Chapter One inequities were also investigated, finding that Chapter One money often went to schools that were spending as much as $20,000 a student, like in Beverly Hills and Scarsdale, N.Y., which still get funds despite being wealthy communities with few poor students. For the 40th anniversary of Brown V. Board of Education, we looked at school segregation, using data that goes back to 1968 and followed Harvard University Professor Gary Orfield's methodology, who found that schools were becoming more segregated for the first time since the 1960s. For spending, we used three years' worth of the Census Survey of Governments, Education Finance Record, to examine spending for school construction, combined with racial and poverty data to show that minority inner-city schools spend less than white suburban districts."
