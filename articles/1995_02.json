            "full_text": "It was one of those times when the computer print-out makes you feel like a prospector staring at a gold nugget in your pan. This was supposed to be a list of farmers participating in a property tax abatement program intended to preserve farmland. Yet the list included the names of some of the richest people and the largest companies in the United States. It included the names of land developers who have played a major role in Delaware transforming farmland into housing tracts. Several sharpened queries and dozens of field trips to eyeball the 'farms' later we had the basis of our story. Only the interviews remained. Delaware's farmland preservation program had become a means for the owners of big country estates, oil and chemical companies and land developers to avoid paying property taxes. The state law governing the program was too weak to enforce and county officials had stopped trying. The farmland preservation program actually had the effect of helping to finance land development. In one case, a 400-acre parcel of land zoned for a regional shopping mall avoided $86,000 in property taxes by claiming to be a farm. Nothing save scrub pine trees grew there. The story drew one of the greatest responses from the public and the government of any we have ever published. Within days, governments at every level had appointed task forces to study the abuse. Legislators and county councilmen were deluged with calls from voters. Reform of the system is likely in the current session of the General Assembly. All this from a routine database. For general reference purposes, we had acquired property records on 9-track tape from each of Delaware's three counties. We also planned to do a story on whether property tax burdens are unfair. You answer that question straightforwardly, using a sample of recent estate sales to determine actual housing market values and then computing the percentage of market value the assessment of each home comprises. With out-of-date assessments like those in Delaware, you can expect that the most expensive homes will be taxed on the smallest percentage of their actual value. It's a predictable but worthy story. In short, we set out to illustrate something we believed we already knew. Nothing wrong in that, unless we had cruised past the best story. Because we were interested mainly in the assessment of residential properties, we nearly neglected to run a list of..."

            "full_text": "When a plane crashes - like the USAir jet outside Pittsburgh - journalists are quick to reveal the aircraft maintenance records maintained by the Federal Aviation Administration. But a huge piece of the puzzle is the FAA's own sloppy record keeping, and the way airlines compile information. The reporters went back to the FAA, back to airlines, back to overseers, mechanics, pilots, manufacturers and experts. What they found were problems everywhere. Perhaps there is no better way to dramatize the gaps than this: In July 1992, a TWA L-1011 was taking off at New York's JFK International Airport. The pilot said he saw a warning system telling him that the engines were stalling. He aborted the takeoff, veered off the runway and the plane erupted into flames. Fifty-one passengers suffered minor injuries. Investigators started checking on L-1011 warning systems. They found only two FAA reports of stall-warning system failures. But then they went further. Lockheed, the maker of the jet, had its own files. Those showed an additional 14 instances where warning systems went wrong. Investigators then looked at TWA. The airline had records of another 10 malfunctions. In other words, the FAA was missing records for 24 out of 26 incidents where warning systems went wrong a problem that appears to have contributed to a high-profile airplane accident. Cleveland's Plain Dealer has been sifting through FAA records since November and published its first investigation last month. The results show the TWA accident does not represent the exception. It embodies the way of life at an agency that's supposed to regulate airline safety. The newspaper has been exploring the FAA's service difficulty reports, often referred to by their initials, SDR. The records are not supposed to be some kind of bureaucratic wasteland. They're designed to play a vital role - helping the FAA troubleshoot airplanes by looking for trends. But bad data and a lack of staff mean the FAA can't do the job. The funny thing is, that isn't the story Plain Dealer set out to do. The newspaper sent two reporters - Elizabeth Marchak and Keith Epstein - to find which airlines are the safest and least safe. They were also told to do the same for types of aircraft. And, to drive the point home, they were told to concentrate on aircraft flying in and out of Cleveland's Hopkins International Airport. Marchak and Epstein used the FAA's SDR database as a starting point. But it was just that: a starting point. FoxPro proved a powerful tool. The reporters conducted a variety of searches, categorizing and ranking records by aircraft and maintenance problem. Here are some of the stumbling blocks, and how Marchak and Epstein worked to get things right. The SDR database tracks planes with tail numbers and serial numbers. But airlines over the years may repaint identification numbers. That rendered tail numbers almost meaningless as a way to rummage through the SDR database. Airlines also don't consistently report airplane serial numbers. In addition, the airlines are supposed to rank the seriousness of the maintenance problem on a scale of 1 to 5. However, the Plain Dealer found those rankings are often haphazard. Marchak spotted the shifting serial numbers while performing data analysis. Sometimes they were three digits. In later years, they were six digits. Marchak went into the data line by line to get serial numbers to match. Despite the problems encountered, serial numbers are still the easiest way to follow an aircraft's history. At the same time, the Plain Dealer asked those airlines flying in and out of Cleveland to send lists of the aircraft they were using, including tail numbers. And the newspaper sent a reporter to spend a day at Hopkins, jotting down all the tail numbers. Marchak later checked those numbers against the SDR databases. And a lot of numbers were not matching up. The problem wasn't obvious at first. The gap became apparent not by checking serial numbers, but the dates in the SDR database for when the planes underwent repairs. That's when Marchak noticed a disturbing mismatch: a lot of jets flying out of Hopkins showed no maintenance updates since 1992. The reporters went back to the FAA, back to airlines, back to overseers, mechanics, pilots, manufacturers and experts. What they found were problems everywhere. In some instances, the airlines were submitting the data to the FAA - sometimes doing the job electronically - yet the information couldn't always be found in SDR. Many times, the airlines were not reporting maintenance as many as nine of 10 repairs went unreported The problem was particularly acute among commuter airlines. And the FAA, left with weak provisions to enforce the rules, can do little to force airlines to change their ways. In addition, records were sloppy- Repairs were often mislabeled. The judgment was left to airline mechanics, who sometimes softpeddle the seriousness of a repair. Marchak and Epstein also looked for what wasn't tracked at all in the database, and found key numbers were missing - the number of hours flown, and number of takeoffs. The stuff that would better track the repairs versus wear and tear. Along with poor documentation and no enforcement, the Plain Dealer used the database as a springboard to show how the FAA poorly analyzes its own records. Agency officials admitted that, in the wake of budget cutbacks, spotting dangerous trends with SDR doesn't get done. The kicker: FAA employees often don't use the agency's database. A private consultant is among those who buys SDR data. He repackages the information and resells the data. Among his biggest customers is - that's right - the FAA. Agency workers find its easier to sift through his version, instead of the FAA's own compilation. For journalists using FAA data, the Plain Dealer's analysis offers another lesson. Learning an aircraft's maintenance record sometimes reveals less than meets the eye. The Plain Dealer demonstrated that by profiling a MidWest Express aircraft with a raft of repairs. The newspaper compared that with the USAir jet that crashed outside Pittsburgh. The MidWest Express passengers were on an airplane that underwent more than 144 repairs, but there appears nothing that should have raised concerns. The same went for the USAir flight's 37 repairs. 'Trivial' was the way one expert described the maintenance record. In the article Marchak and Epstein wrote: 'The two planes' histories illustrate the perils - for regulators, inspectors, reporters and the public - of drawing conclusions about relative safety from information in federal government computers. Even though that's why the computerized information exists in the first place.' For more information, the reporters can be reached by phone at 202-638-1366.

            "full_text": "Computer-assisted reporting at the St Louis Post-Dispatch has gone from a highly specialized skill to just part of the job. We were among the first papers in the country to dedicate a full-time reporter to computer-related projects. Now, we are working to mainstream CAR into the newsroom, and are encouraging beat and specialty reporters to incorporate the power of personal computers onto their beats. Management - from the managing editor to assistant city editors is pushing reporters and editors to embrace the gospel of spreadsheets and databases. 'I want to get computers out of the temple and into the professional kit of everyone in our newsroom,' says Managing Editor Foster Davis. 'The computer does ordinary tasks so rapidly it seems like a genius instead of a stupid workaholic. The more that people understand what tasks the computer can do, the more they are freed to do the work that a computer cannot do. What drives me nuts is seeing bright people tied up doing stuff a computer could do for them, if we equipped them and trained them.' The Post-Dispatch also has specialized hardware, such as a nine-track drive and a 1-gig magneto-optical drive. This spring, we will buy a large NT server (with 16 GB of storage space) to provide true client-server database services. Spending money and time training people. We have sent nine staff members so far to the NICAR boot camp. In February 1995, we are scheduled to begin an in-house computer-assisted training program that will cover everything from data acquisition to index tags. Getting everyone on the Internet. The publisher has approved an Internet node for high-speed access from all office PCs. In addition, we have contracted to provide full Internet access from home for any reporter or editor who wants it. Several reporters and editors already have e-mail addresses, but we want to make knowledge of the Internet part of every reporter's job. We also are maintaining our commitment to bigger computer-assisted projects. Our practice has been to pair a beat reporter or reporters with the CAR specialist, which has allowed us to draw on the expertise of both sides, to get stories into the paper faster and to show more reporters the power of the PC. Tim Novak and I analyzed 130,000 Illinois pension records to show that legislators had written state pension law to favor themselves and state judges. Joan Little and I found that black students overwhelmingly make up the waiting list to get into magnet schools, considered among the best in St. Louis. Carolyn Tuft, Joe Holleman and I (all NICAR bootcamp grads) matched records of people licensed to drive ambulances in Missouri with the database of moving violations. We found that the state was not doing background checks on applicants, and that people with poor driving records and multiple drunken-driving convictions were licensed to drive ambulances. Our story led to other stories about the state granting ambulance licenses to people who had stolen drugs and money from ambulance districts. The stories prompted the state to remove the head of ambulance licensing and to change the policy for granting licenses. Post-Dispatch beat reporters are beginning to do their own data analysis for investigative and enterprise stories - in addition to the work done by the two people who work full time on computer-related projects. Washington correspondent Kathy Best (a NICAR bootcamp grad) used Microsoft FoxPro to track spending in a U.S. Senate election in Missouri to find out what areas of the state and country were giving the most. Business reporter Jerri Stroud used Excel and Atlas GIS to analyze and map farmers' participation in the federal Conservation Reserve Program. Here's how we are involving our newsroom more deeply in computer-assisted efforts: Giving people the hardware and software they need. We have about 80 486 PCs in our newsroom and bureaus. We hope early this year to hit our goal of providing a PC to every reporter who wants one. The machines have enough disk space, memory and horsepower to allow a beat reporter to analyze just about any chunk of data. We equip our machines with Excel, FoxPro and Microsoft Access. We have several reporters proficient in FoxPro, but we are starting to make the transition to Access as our primary database manager. We also have other software, such as Atlas GIS and SPSS."
