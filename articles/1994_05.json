    "full_text": "NICAR has taken its show on the road. In addition to its week-long seminars held at the University of Missouri, NICAR is offering on-site training for news organizations throughout the country. NICAR kicked off its traveling program in the great white north with one-day training programs for the Alaska Press Club, the Juneau Press Club and the Anchorage Daily News in April. We've also conducted training overviews for a regional conference in La Crosse, Wisconsin, and the Kansas City Star. Our next stops include Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento with more penciled on our calendar, including appearances in Philadelphia, Nashville, Atlanta, and Evansville. The on-site training ranges from a basic overview on computer-assisted reporting to hands-on training for a variety of software, including databases, spreadsheets, and statistics. The program can be tailored to your specific training needs. The cost of the program depends on its complexity and whether we provide hands-on training. Smaller news organizations or associations may pool resources to bring a seminar to their area. For those of you in warmer climates, please consider having NICAR visit November through March as we are not yet used to Missouri winters."
