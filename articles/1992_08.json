    "full_text": "Journalists are facing new challenges in gaining access to electronic records, with bureaucrats employing tactics to delay or deny requests. Instances in Missouri and Pennsylvania illustrate the struggle reporters face in obtaining data, encountering bureaucratic stalling, high costs, and use of outdated formats. Despite legal rights to information, reporters like Al Hasbrouck and Dave Armstrong experience hurdles, such as receiving data in unfamiliar code or encountering new redaction logic preventing access. In Washington, new laws promising faster responses now seem to legitimize delays. Texas faces similar issues with agencies printing massive records to deter access. Cost is another obstacle, with exorbitant fees posed as a deterrent. Nevertheless, reporters persist through legal battles and strategies to overcome these bureaucratic tactics."
