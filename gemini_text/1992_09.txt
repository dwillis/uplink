the
seductive
technology

A story of failure and four myths
that made it possible

BY RONALD CAMPBELL
The Orange County Register

At 8:20 p.m. on May 9, a sleeping
3-year-old boy was whipped
from his mother's lap by an exploding
tire tread and dragged to his death
beneath the wheels of a bus.

The bizarre death of Ramon
Prado provided an occasion - an
excuse, really - for The Orange
County Register to publish results of
its seven-month probe of bus safety in
California.

The story showed that the
California Highway Patrol routinely
fails to meet its legal mandate to
inspect buses. But as the story also
noted, California's buses have racked
up an enviable safety record. And
even if CHP inspectors had found and
inspected the bus on which Ramon
Prado later died, they could have
done nothing about a floor so thin
that a tire tread could breach it; the
floor met federal standards.

So much for seven months work.

The story, and the endless
research that went into it, illustrate
what I call seduction by technology.
Entranced by the siren song of high
tech, I pursued a story long after my
instincts told me it wasn't there.

Most articles in Uplink tell of
triumphs. This is a story of failure and
the four journalistic myths that made
it possible.

It began in July 1991, with a bus
crash near Palm Springs that took the
lives of seven people. The Register
immediately began casting about for a
way to investigate bus safety. We
discovered the CHP's Management
Information System of Terminal
Evaluation Records, aka MISTER.

It sounded perfect: computer-
ized records on 90,000 bus and truck
companies, including every traffic
ticket, every accident and every CHP
inspection of bus or truck terminals.
CHP's reaction made the database
seem even better: They demanded
$2,800. Over the next three months
we argued the price down to $81.18.

Enter Myth No. 1: If a bureau-
crat hinders or refuses access to
public documents, those records must
be explosive. That might have been
true, sometimes, in the days when
governments kept its records in
manila folders. Today, when agencies
routinely keep gigabyte-sized data-
bases, it's absurd to presume that
custodians know what they're hiding.

Under the spell of Myth No. 1, I
was easy prey for Myth No. 2: Gather
enough facts and you're bound to
find a great story. All reporters play
hunches, looking under rocks for
something odd. With computers
comes the temptation to look under
every grain of sand on the beach.

That is what I did with MISTER.
Had I faced a similar quantity of
paper records, I instantly would have
turned away for a reality check. I
would have called some experts, read
some reports and chosen one or two
angles to explore. Instead I plunged
into the database with all the direc-
tion of a near-sighted man on a foggy
night.

"How many people die on
buses?" I asked the database. Very few.
"How often do buses crash?" Not
often. "What does 'often' mean?"
Good question, since even CHP
doubts the mileage numbers in
MISTER.

One day I extracted a list of
multiple-injury bus accidents. The
heaviest toll by far, more than 50
injuries, was for an accident a year
earlier within a few miles of the
Register. I could not find a word
about that accident in the paper. A
local CHP flack looked it up for me:
The bus was ferrying prisoners

the seductive technology

between court and jail; most of the "injured"
were inmates complaining of whiplash.

Myths No. 3 and 4 made an already bad
situation nightmarish. I suspect both myths
are common among computer-assisted
reporters.

Myth No. 3: Databases are the perfect
reflection of the real world. Think about that
one for a second. Intellectually, of course, no
one believes it. But emotionally we tend to
invest databases with a God-like aura of
omniscience. They seem so complete.

In fact, however, databases merely
record what their keepers meant them to
record, to the degree their keepers can get
the information.

It's easy to lose sight of those limita-
tions. MISTER listed hundreds of companies
that no longer existed. It omitted bus and
truck accidents on local roads, unless police
went to the trouble of informing the CHP.
MISTER's record of hazardous spills abruptly
stopped in 1990 when CHP "temporarily"
stopped entering the data.

Before I ever used a mainframe, I was a
devotee of Myth No. 4: Mainframes are big,
fast and unstoppable — the Incredible Hulk of
the Information Age.

The myth is correct on one point.
Mainframes are indeed big. So was Tyranno-
saurus Rex.

I thought I needed a mainframe to
handle MISTER; at 160 megabytes, it would
have stretched the capacity of my PC and
overwhelmed XDB, the database program I
use. It would have taken weeks to get a few
simple answers, I thought.

So I used a mainframe instead. And it
did not take weeks to get simple answers; it
took months.

We lumbered along, the Register's
information services department and I, for
three months before I framed my first query
to the MISTER database. It took time to install
the hardware linking my PC with the main-
frame, time to teach me how to use the link,
time to load MISTER and then to load it again
when the first layout didn't work.

Then the real problems began.
Contrary to its legend, I found the
mainframe balky. I would ask what I thought
was a simple question and then wait and wait -
until an irritated computer tech would call,
asking why I was consuming 90 percent of the
central processing unit's capacity.

I would have to ask four or five questions
on the mainframe where one would have
sufficed on the PC. And after other users
began to complain in droves about that crazy
new user monopolizing the computer, the
high priests of the mainframe restricted my
access.

As the weeks dragged into months, I
began to dread afternoons digging into the
database. Few findings excited me, and never
for long; if I found an intriguing pattern in
the river of printouts, I usually found a flaw
an hour or a day later.

Ramon Prado rescued me from all this.
Months before his death I had noticed that
the CHP was failing its mandate to inspect
every bus terminal. Absent a healthy dose of
mayhem, this was just one more tiny instance
of decaying state service. Prado's death, which
no inspector could have prevented, make bus
inspections newsworthy. In retrospect, my
failure with MISTER offers a couple of easy
lessons: First, never use a computer you don't
control; the control issue alone makes a
newsroom PC superior to a mainframe.
Second, before you buy a database, before
you spend months probing its secrets, find
out its weaknesses.

But the major lesson is one that I am
not yet sure I have mastered: A database is not
a story; it just might lead to a story, but it is
not a story. Lose sight of that lesson, and you
too can be seduced by technology.

Had I faced a similar quantity of paper records, I instantly would have turned
away for a reality check.... Instead I plunged into the database with all the
direction of a nearsighted man on a foggy night.

PROBLEM SOLVING AT
U.S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT

BY JOHN BARE
Ph.D. candidate at the University of North
Carolina-Chapel Hill

U.S. News and World Report's summer
plunge into computer-assisted reporting
illustrated a multi-method approach to prob-
lems encountered in working with the Food and
Drug Administration's Medical Device Report-
ing system.

As an intern hired to help develop com-
puter-assisted reporting projects at U.S. News, I
worked with section editors, senior writers,
associate editors and administrative staff. The
magazine's library and its corporate data services
division devoted substantial resources to com-
puter-assisted reporting projects.

In addition to the magazine's standard
word-processing system, ATEX, I used Oracle
version 6.0 with SQL Forms, SPSS/PC+ version
4.01, WordPerfect version 5.1 and Lotus 1-2-3
release 3. An AST 386SX/20 connected to a
VAX mainframe by an ethernet network was set
aside for computer-assisted projects.

The result was "Danger: Implants" (Aug.
4, 1992), a six-page story in the News You Can
Use section. Using the MDR computer tapes,
U.S. News examined five medical devices set to
undergo regulatory scrutiny next year. U.S. News
devoted the most attention to penile implants,
combining traditional reporting techniques with
more scientific methods.

The magazine's corporate data services
division loaded the MDR tapes onto the VAX
and created a database using Oracle. From my
personal computer, I was able to log on to the
VAX in just a few seconds. Using Oracle, I could
retrieve selected records, sort by fields and
produce reports that could be imported into
other software packages for additional analysis.

Soon after obtaining the FDA tapes,
however, we discovered a major obstacle. When
records were sorted by accession number (the
MDR equivalent of identification numbers) and
product code, the report revealed several
problems, including thousands of duplicate
records. An FDA programming error had
rendered the tapes virtually useless. More
meetings with the FDA were scheduled to
resolve the problem.

The one thing we learned from the tapes is
that key information contained in a text field
cannot be sorted. The MDR's massive "event
description" field consists of a text paragraph
composed by data entry personnel that describes
how and why the medical problem occurred.

NEWS YOU CAN USE
DANGER:
IMPLANTS

THE FDA IS SET TO HIT FIVE medical devices as part of a sweeping
re-examination of its medical arsenal that is well over
a decade overdue. The group of five includes such mundane items as
surgical staples and adhesive tape, along with more-exotic ones like
breast implants. Some 130 categories of high-risk medical devices
or so stand to undergo re-examination. All appeared after 1976, the
year that the Food and Drug Administration got its authority to govern the
products. Under activist chief David Kessler and with added clout from 1990
law, the FDA plans to scrutinize the entire 130-item list. For a first look at special
attention starting next year saline-filled breast implants, inflatable penile
implants, testicular implants, surgical drapes and staplers/tackers,
U.S. News has looked at all five devices, using FDA data and through the
Freedom of Information Act. In-depth computer analysis suggests that penile
implants deserve closer examination. Here's the five, starting from the following report.

THE ONE THING WE LEARNED FROM THE TAPES IS THAT KEY
INFORMATION CONTAINED IN A TEXT FIELD CANNOT BE SORTED.

With penile implant reports, for instance,
the patient's age (if listed at all) is in the event
description field, as is the date of the implant
operation and the details of the medical device
problem. Because this information is buried in a
text field, we could not instruct a database
program to sort the penile implant records by
patient age, implant date or problem type.

Even worse, the form in which the MDR
information is archived is inconsistent. The
event description field may say that the penile
implant patient is 42 years old, or it may say that
he was born 8/12/50. One entry might describe
the problem as a "leak." Another might say "lost
fluid." Still another might say "leakage from
reservoir." An implant might protrude, extrude,
erode or break the skin. This haphazard style of
reporting device problems made it difficult to
devise a surefire method of dumping the event
description paragraphs into a text analysis or
word processing system for more detailed
analysis.

So just as social scientists use multiple
methods to tackle tough problems, we added
another prong to the computer-assisted report-
ing task. While waiting for a new set of accurate
MDR tapes, we completed an old fashioned,
hand-coded content analysis of penile implant
problem reports, using a sample of 1,196
implant records drawn from microfiche copies
of the MDR tapes. We recorded product names,
manufacturer names, the report description
(death, serious injury or malfunction), report
date, date of implant and patient age. In
addition, we established nine categories of
problems and coded the reports accordingly.

SEPTEMBER 1992 3
==End of OCR for page 3==

==Start of OCR for page 4==
Data from the code sheets were keypunched
into Lotus and then imported into an SPSS system
file for statistical analysis. With the push of a
button, we could find out things such as 8 percent
of the penile implants involved infections and the
average age of patients with penile implant
problems is 56.

By subtracting the implant date from the
MDR report date (SPSS "compute" command),
we created a variable of the number of years
between the implant operation and the problem
report. The distribution ranged from zero years
(implant and problem in same year) to 16 years
but was skewed heavily, with about 62 percent of
the problems occurring within three years of the
implant date.

By this time, new MDR tapes arrived, and
integrity checks indicated that there were no
problems. The tapes contained approximately
176,000 medical device problem reports from
1984 through mid-June 1992. Of these, 8,064
records were singled out as penile implant
problem reports.

In our continuing effort to cull from the
event description field information about why the
implant problems occurred, we created separate
Oracle reports for each of the 13 penile implant
models cited most often in the MDR tapes. The
reports contained the full text of the event
descriptions.

A macro WordPerfect program was written
to search for terms and count frequencies. We
counted the number of times such terms as
"leak," "lost fluid" and "infection" appeared in the
event descriptions. As explained earlier, the FDA's
inconsistent reporting style makes this sort of
measure imperfect. Here, however, the method
served as a backup check to the hand-coded
content analysis sample.

Another check came from the FDA, whose
analysts are able to sort medical device problems
by categories. U.S. News obtained FDA analyses
of problem types for the 13 penile implants cited
most often. Because the FDA's system did not
always fit our needs, it was not desirable to rely
solely on FDA data, but again it was a valuable
check.

This multi-method approach produced
three sources of information regarding specific
types of penile implant problems: the content
analysis of 1,196 records, the frequency counts
from WordPerfect and the FDA analysis. From
this we produced a box that ran at the close of
the story listing the most common problems
associated with various models of penile implants.

For media such as U.S. News that are just
starting to utilize computer-assisted reporting
techniques, the road to completing projects is
filled with an endless string of potholes. As
crucial as it is for reporters to narrow their
research question and devise an effective
methodology, it is just as important to be able
to react positively when glitches occur. Whether
or not such projects ultimately succeed de-
pends in large part on the willingness of the
news organization to assemble a team of players
flexible and creative enough to solve the
problems they could not have foreseen. For
U.S. News and other media that have moved
past discussing computer-assisted reporting
ideas and actually produced publishable work,
they now face new challenges. They must
educate editors and reporters about the
advantages of computer-assisted methods,
provide year-round in-house training and make
computer-assisted reporting techniques part of
their daily routine.

Real help for data junkies

Keeping up with the wide range of
developments in the field of public data
can be pretty tough for reporters on
the beat.

But the Association of Public Data
Users can help with that.

A sort of data-junkie support group,
the association provides a forum for
interaction between data users,
sources and producers through its
newsletter and conferences.

The eight- to ten-page newsletter is
packed full of information that would
be pretty dry to anyone except a data
addict.

The front page stories of the May
1992 issue of the APDU Newsletter
were esoteric but informative.

"The Mother of All User Fees"
updates readers on the latest round in
the user fee debate: U.S. Courts might
be given authority to fund facility costs
through fees on the use of the judicial
system.

Sharing the front page was an article
about a proposal by the Office of
Management and Budget to amend
federal policies relating to information
dissemination, records management
and cooperation between state and
local governments.

Inside pages are filled with short
descriptions of new government and
private data releases available through
a variety of mediums. Some of this stuff
is really far out, yet fascinating.

The Calendar section lists
instructional seminars around the
country.

Useful tidbits of information, including
legislative updates and technical
information, are sprinkled throughout
the newsletter. For example, the
Census Bureau has announced an error
in STF3A data, and it looks like CD-
ROMs are falling far short of their
expected 20-year lifespan.

It costs $300 to join the Association
of Public Data Users. Besides a
newsletter, members get a telephone
contact list for government data
agencies and can share the cost of a
database with other members. For

Tech tips: Eliminating happy faces
and other garbage characters

BY BRANT HOUSTON
The Hartford Courant

Subject: Cleaning up data from a file on
diskette so you can run a match in XDB.

Problem: You find out that a small state
agency has collected information on thou-
sands of businesses and keeps that informa-
tion on a diskette. You want to merge that
information with your own database of a
couple of hundred business names.

Before you can worry about spelling
differences in the names, you discover that
the agency's file is, not surprisingly, fraught
with problems, including garbage characters.
And your problems aren't over after you
import it into database software.

Solution: If you are a journalist who is
just getting into computer-assisted reporting,
you probably don't have programming skills.
But that's not a problem if you have a quick
text editor and use a little imagination with
XDB.

One commercial text editor is XYWrite
III Plus. Copy the agency file onto your hard
disk as BIZINFO and look at it by calling it up
through XYWrite.

There is the file in all its ugliness with
ASCII characters (such as the ubiquitous and
ironic happy face) popping up here and there.
The nice thing about XYWrite III Plus is that it
has an ASCII menu from which you can pluck
the offending character and put in the header
area.

By typing CH /{happy face}// in the header area
and hitting enter, XYWrite will race through
the file and eliminate the happy faces. You
can do whatever search-and-destroy mis-
sions you need to on other garbage charac-
ters. You can also eliminate unwanted
spaces with CH / /, and add a character, if
needed, with the same function.

Another nice feature of XYWrite is that it
stores a backup of the original file in case you
get excited by all the destruction and blast
away an innocent character.

When you import BIZINFO as a comma
delimited file, the quote marks around the
company names also get imported. (This
actually happened to me.) That means there
are company names with quotes around
them in BIZINFO, and there are no quotes
around company names in your own file (call
it BIZNAME).

Rather than taking awhile to figure out
what is going on (which might mean fathoming
bits and bytes, hidden characters and tabs,
etc.), there is a quick solution.

Export BIZNAME from XDB as a comma
delimited file with quotes around characters.
Then re-import it as a fixed file, BIZNAME2.
That brings those names back into XDB with
quotes. Your company names now have a
chance of matching because they have quotes
around them in both files.

At this point you might want to use
XDB's command Xleft to run a join on the first
nine characters in name field in each file in
order to pick up most of your matches.

For example:
Select A.*, B.Name
From BIZINFO A, BIZNAME2 B
Where Xleft (A.Name,9) =
Xleft(B.Name,9)

Make sure you index both name fields
before running it.

You may have to clean up the data
further by using XDB's Update command, but
you are well on your way at this point.

I'm sure there are other effective text
editors and that a little programming knowl-
edge would go a long way toward solving
these problems in a better manner. The
bizarre importing of names is just an example
to show how to clean and shape data by using
the import and export functions in XDB.
Nonetheless, these tricks do come in handy
when importing data from an optical scanner
or an online source such as the Federal
Election Commission.

CORRECTION

In last month's Tech Tips, Elliot
Jaspin made some suggestions for
dealing with various spellings of a
company, such as "Amalgamated Zoot
Suits," within a database called
BADSPELL. But Uplink printed one
command incorrectly.
The correct command is:
Update BADSPELL
Set NewName = "Amalagated"
Where Xleft(name, 11) =
"Amalgamated"

Our apologies.

If you are a
journalist who
is just getting
into computer-
assisted
reporting,
you probably
don't have
programming
skills. But that's
not a problem
if you have a
quick text editor
and use a little
imagination
with XDB.

Elliot Jaspin, MICAR's founder, has
left the University of Missouri School of
Journalism to take a position with Cox
Newspapers in Washington, D.C. We'll miss
his smiling mug around the office, but he's
promised to continue advising us on techni-
cal matters and help out when he can with
MICAR's programs. In fact, his first return
engagement was last month when he came to
help teach a week-long TRI-DART seminar.

MICAR and its programs will continue
at the School of Journalism with some help
from Investigative Reporters & Editors, a
non-profit organization also based at the
University of Missouri.

Bruce Melzer at the Anchorage Daily
News discovered the feds don't know their
state abbreviations.

When Melzer tried to call up Alaskan
lending institutions in the Home Mortgage
Disclosure Act data, he got Arkansas too.

Apparently whoever entered the data
used "AK" as the abbreviation for both states
at least part of the time.

HMDA data is divided into two files.
"LARS Public" contains information about
the loan and loan applicant. This first file lists
lending institutions by a numeric code
composed of two fields: "respondent id" and
"agency code."

This code must be cross-referenced with
the second file, "TS Public," which contains
the name and address of the lending institu-
tions, including two-letter state abbreviations.

Inaccurate state abbreviations make
filtering the TS file by state difficult. But it's
not likely anybody would need to do this.

Instead, use the numeric state code in
LARS to filter for applicants in the desired
state. Then search the TS file using the
institution code to get names and addresses
of lending institutions.
