CHILD WELFARE
Measuring foster care

By Jason Method
Asbury Park Press

Despite New Jersey's child protection
agency's two-year, $128 million reform effort,
children who are wards of the state are spend-
ing more time in foster care, group homes and
institutions than just a few years ago. That was
the key finding when the Asbury Park Press de-
cided to find out how much, if any, progress
the state had made in its reform goals.

Like in many states, the child protec-
tion agency is veiled under confidential-
ity laws. To make reporting more difficult,
New Jersey has one of the weakest public

CENSUS 2000
Race problem
solutions

By Steve Doig
Arizona State University

A year ago (see the January/February
2000 Uplink) I wrote about the looming
problem of making valid comparisons of
the racial and Hispanic origin data from
1990 and 2000. In that piece, I followed
journalism's great thumbsucker tradition
of raising an alarm but offering no solid
solutions. Well, the problem is no longer
looming - it's here, so it's time to focus
on solutions.

The problem, of course, is that in the
2000 Census, respondents were allowed
to check off as many racial categories as
they wished, whereas respondents in
1990 and earlier could only pick one race
to describe themselves. This meant that
the ten possible 1990 race and Hispanic
origin categories (ranging from "Non-
Hispanic white" to "Hispanic Other")
have ballooned to a total of 126 possible

access laws in the nation. DYFS officials
turned down my request for some dozen
statistical reports that would have docu-
mented the agency's performance.

Fortunately, I learned of a database kept
by the federal government that can pierce
through the confidentiality laws and bu-
reaucratic resistance. The database tracks
the some 600,000 children, in all but a
handful of states, who are under state fos-
ter care or are in other state facilities. CAR
journalists may use the database to evaluate
state child protection agencies through the sys-
temic criteria used by child welfare experts and
to track that performance over time.

The Adoption and Foster Care Analysis
and Reporting System contains detailed in-
formation on every child who has entered
care in a federal fiscal year. The foster care
data includes the date of birth, sex and race.
It gives other important dates, such as the
date the child last entered state care and the
date the child was discharged. It provides rea-
sons why the child was removed and indi-
cates any physical disability.

AFCARS, which comes only in an SPSS
or SAS format, also has variables tracking how
many foster homes or other state facilities the
child has been placed in, how many times
they have been removed from their natural
home, and what type of placement — such
as foster home, group home or institution
— the child was last reported in.

A second database that comes with the
AFCARS data documents adoptions of
former foster children or children placed by
the state agencies across the country. It con-
tains the same biographical and date infor-
mation as the foster care database.

Names and addresses are excluded from
the datasets and dates of birth are altered
slightly for confidentiality reasons. But that

IN THE NEWSROOM
CAR newsletters

By Richard Dalton
Newsday

So you do computer-assisted reporting at
your news organization and you've decided
that with all the spare time on your hands,
you might as well start an in-house newslet-
ter to spread the CAR gospel to the rest of
the newsroom?

Great. You've joined a handful of other
newsrooms.

Even with a limited amount of time, you
can produce a CAR newsletter that is both
practical and inspirational. Here are some tips
on creating CAR newsletters. CAR enthusi-
asts sent in some tips, while I culled others
from reading newsletters.

For some examples of in-house newslet-
ters, including Car Talk, Byte Me and Mouse
Droppings, check out www.kricar.com.

This-Is-How-I-Did-It articles

The best way to provide both practical
advice and inspiration is the TIHIDI article
— the This-Is-How-I-Did-It piece. Uplink
is chock full of TTHIDI articles, and for good
reason. Such pieces show how you can repli-
cate the story in your area and help you brain-
storm. And the articles offer the Wow fac-
tor: "Wow, it's amazing what you can do with
computer-assisted reporting."

Even with a limited
amount of time, you can
produce a CAR newsletter
that is both practical and
inspirational.

Even a small in-house newsletter should
contain at least one TIHIDI article. And the
best part is that you can delegate this task:
Ask other staff members to write articles de-
scribing how they wrote a CAR story. If you're
part of a chain, ask other reporters in your
chain to contribute.

The piece should briefly describe the CAR
story, indicate what software was used, what
databases were analyzed and how they were
obtained. A box accompanying the story should
list some of the key fields in the database.

If CAR reporting is quite active in your
newsroom, run a roundup of CAR stories.

CAR Q&A

Answer questions that reporters submit
to the newsletter. Or if you help out another
reporter in person, turn the help session into
a Q&A for the newsletter.

Software Tips

Microsoft Excel and Access are the most
commonly used software tools in CAR. Fo-
cus on those products initially, starting with
simple tips: subtotals, importing data from
HTML documents, etc.

Don't let 'em lose it

You know how easy it is to lose something
amidst the mounds of papers on a reporter's
desk. So, Jennifer LaFleur, of the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch recommends printing the news-
letter on obnoxiously bright paper, so it won't
get lost in the shuffle. In her previous job in
San Jose, she gave out binders for reporters to
store tip sheets and copies of the newsletter.

Point out CAR resources

Highlight useful Web sites for finding
anything from phone numbers to govern-
ment data. What databases does your news
organization have? Focus on a few, listing
possible story ideas. List CAR resources re-
porters can turn to, including possibly your-
self. Does your news organization offer train-
ing in Microsoft Excel or Access? List the
schedule of classes. Or hold some classes
yourself. Also point out books or videos on
CAR software. Do you have tech-support
people who can answer questions about soft-
ware? If so, point reporters in their direction
(and save yourself some time.)

Highlight Math Tips

Include tips on calculating percentage
change, per-capita rates, inflation adjustments, etc.

ing almost entirely on contributions from re-

CENSUS 2000
Historical data sources

By Neill A. Borowski
The Philadelphia Inquirer

My squirrel-like habits of burying histori-
cal census data like acorns to be uncovered
in the future began in the days of paper.

And my prized "database" is a booklet
called Recent Historical Trends, published by
the Philadelphia City Planning Commission.
How "recent" are the trends? The report was
published in 1966 and long ago fell apart (it's
held together with a binder clip). But that re-
port is packed with detail on population and
race in parts of the city going back to 1930.

Should you be as obsessed? If you're so in-
clined, your newspaper could benefit greatly
from historical local census data online -avail-
able well in advance of the flood of 2000 data.

Electronic data archives should be easier
to build than paper ones. But they aren't.

I discovered this recently when I began to
ask around about the availability of 1970 and
1980 census data in computer form. A typi-
cal answer from one agency in Pennsylvania
that hands out such data was "We don't have
anything that old."

If you build a historical census archive for
your area, you may have the only such archive
around. You will be building something use-
ful to reporters and editors that will be around
long after you're gone.

However, you may find yourself behind
closed doors - as I have been - reconciling
an ArcView census tract map on your com-
puter screen with an old paper map from
1950. Yet, imagine how powerful a graphic
we'll have to accompany a story on popula-
tion change in a given Philadelphia neigh-
borhood: 50 years of change, from 1950-
2000.

You may not want to get so nerdy that
you include every census tract from 1960 in
your archive. But you may want to have the
populations of minor civil divisions (town-
ships, cities, boroughs) or counties going back
50 or more years.

A few ideas to get started in your quest to
pin the wonk-meter's needle:

• Visit your local library. Tucked away on
shelves you'll often find dusty printed vol-
umes of census results going back decades.
Photocopy the pages and have the data in-
put to build a database.

• Stop by the "United States Historical
Census Data Browser" at http://
fisher.lib.virginia.edu/census/. You can pull
county-level data going back to the first de-
cennial census in 1790.

• Purchase the 1980 and 1990 data in bulk
from the Census Bureau. Go to
www.census.gov/mp/www/rom/ to check out
pricing and availability. For example, the
1980 STF-3A file for the nation costs $1,500.
However, the cost plunges to $150 if you're
after only one state (the CDs contain several
states each). The 1990 STF-3A file for the
nation costs $4,340. Some single states fit
on one CD at $100 each. Larger states, such
as Pennsylvania, fill several CDs. Pennsylva-
nia, for example, is a three CD set costing
$225. Texas is a four-CD set costing $300.
The PL 94-171 file for 1990 costs $550 for
the nation (10 CDs) or $100 for a single CD.

"Your newspaper could
benefit greatly from
historical local census
data online - available
well in advance of the
flood of 2000 data."

• Buy the 1970 block-level data from the
National Archives at www.nara.gov/nara/elec-
tronic/cen1970.html. The price ranges from $90
for a state to $1,315 for the nation.

• Purchase 1940 through 1970 tract-level
data from the National Archives at
www.nara.gov/nara/electronic/bogue.html.
This dataset, called the "Bogue File," was
created by keypunching paper data as part
of research at the University of Chicago. Not
all areas of the country are represented, al-
though the largest cities are in the data. Each
year is $80 on nine-track tape.

• Buy the CensusCD from GeoLytics Inc.
(www.geolytics.com/). National data for a full
year is available on one CD. This private
firm's slogan is "Making Demographics Easy
to Use!" and using the CensusCDs is far easier

FIRST VENTURE
Felons and nurses

By Randy Travis
WAGA-TV, Atlanta

We've worked long-term investigations
here before, but nothing compares to my
station's first venture into computer-assisted
reporting. As it turned out, the story was well
worth the wait. Even if it took nearly a year.

Our investigation began with an issue
some reporters in other parts of the country
have already tackled: people with criminal
records working in nursing homes.

What intrigued us here in Georgia is a
unique twist in our law. The state certifies
nursing home workers, called certified nurse
aides (CNA). Then, Georgia nursing homes
must do a criminal background check before
they are hired. But the law doesn't preclude
the nursing home administrator from hiring
a convicted felon. With staffing shortages so
critical, we suspected CNAs with criminal
records were still being hired. Turns out, we
were right.

We started with separate open records re-
quests to the state Department of Human
Resources (DHR) and the Department of
Corrections (DOC). DHR maintains a da-
tabase of all certified nurse aides, both past
and current. DOC keeps track of all crimi-
nal convictions, both felony and misde-
meanor. We got the complete DOC data-
base without any trouble, and no charge. Our
first roadblock came in getting what we
needed from DHR.

We felt Social Security numbers provided
the most accurate way to match up names
between the two databases. No problem,
DOC told us. They gave us everything. But
DHR balked at the idea of providing us what
they considered private information. Our
state's open records law does not directly ad-
dress this issue. It took four months of phone
calls to the attorney general's office and DHR
before we finally convinced them the infor-
mation was subject to the open records law.
The disk cost us only $10. But by then, our
plans for a May sweeps series were gone.

Dirty data

It didn't take long, though, for us to real-
ize that the hard work hadn't even begun.
The data from both sources were dirty. In
one table, the Social Security numbers were
separated by dashes. In the other, the num-
bers weren't separated at all. First and last
names were in separate fields in one but
combined in the same field in the other.

That's why we turned to NICAR. They
were able to clean up the data and do the
match between databases. Of the 73,410 nurs-
ing aides, NICAR found 5,595 had a criminal
record. But there was more work to do.

The CNA database included people who
hadn't been certified in years. We didn't want
them included in this investigation. Secondly,
some of the CNAs committed their first
crime after they were certified. Can't blame
a nursing home for that. Yet they still showed
up as a match.

So, we began eliminating matches. Using
Microsoft Access, we first kicked out all
CNAs whose certification expired before
2000. That gave us a list of current criminal
CNAs. Then we took out all CNAs who were
convicted after their certification date. That
eliminated all those CNAs who had clean
records when they were hired, but commit-
ted a crime later on. We wound up with 219
felons and 2,942 probationers currently al-
lowed to work in Georgia nursing homes.
Now it was time to find them.

We felt Social Security
numbers provided the
most accurate way to
match up names between
the two databases. No
problem, DOC told us.

Georgia does not keep track of where cer-
tified nurse aides actually work. So it was
impossible for us to say how many of the
criminal caregivers actually had access to the
elderly. The DHR database did include the
CNA's address at the time of certification.
So, we started there. Thanks to the Web site
healthgrades.com, we used those addresses to
get a list of every nursing home nearby. Then
we started calling asking to speak to some-

Felons

one to verify employment. When we got a
hit, we confirmed it by Social Security num-
ber. We focused on the small communities
that didn't have as many nursing home
choices. We found more than a dozen crimi-
nal caregivers that way.

Crimes at nursing homes

The other part of our investigation looked
at whether criminal caregivers are actually
more likely to commit crimes once they get
inside the nursing home. The state Depart-
ment of Human Resources also maintains an
abuse registry. When a CNA harms a resi-
dent, they wind up on the registry. We
merged the registry with the Department of
Corrections table and found 82 criminals.
Many of them committed the same crime
inside the nursing home that they had on
their record when they were hired: burglary,
assault, theft, etc.

It took us even longer to track down those
victims or their families. By law, they're not
listed in the abuse registry. That meant con-
tacting local police departments and asking
for incident reports of those crimes. But of-
ten, the nursing home didn't bother to call
the police. Months later, we managed to find
family members to react to our investigation.
They had no idea the nurse aide who had
harmed their elderly relative was a criminal
before he was ever hired.

Our series finally aired November 8 and
9, 2000, nearly a year after we made our first
request for the data. The investigation is ex-
pected to prompt a change in the law when
the state general assembly meets in January.

Unfortunately, in an ironic twist, state
lawmakers may also vote to make Social Se-
curity numbers exempt from the open records
law. If you're planning a similar investiga-
tion, fight for that key data. Without it, our
investigation would certainly have taken even
longer.

TECH TIP
Enterprise joins

By Ron Nixon
IRE and NICAR

Enterprise joins- matching databases that
weren't designed to be matched – is one of
the most powerful features of relational da-
tabase managers like FoxPro, Access and Para-
dox. Using enterprise joins, reporters across
the country have successfully matched data-
bases of school bus drives against people with
driving convictions, found dead people vot-
ing in elections, felons with hunting license,
and deadbeat parents in state government.

When seeking databases, reporters should
always think about ways they could join da-
tabases from different agencies or across dif-
ferent fields of study to get stories. Unfortu-
nately, databases rarely have identifying codes
like Social Security numbers or some form
of employee id. In cases where you don't have
this type of information you have to come
up with proxies. Some identifiers could be
birth dates or address like the person's street
number, city or zip code.

Although enterprise joins can produce
great stories they can be fraught with dan-
ger. A wrong match can give you incorrect
information. You could, for example, get a
match for a deadbeat parent working at the
agency that collects delinquent childcare pay-
ments. But since you only matched on the
person's name, the join could be wrong.

Always remember that a name is never a
unique identifier. How may Ron Nixon's are
there or John Smith's? There are probably
thousands. Another thing to remember is that
the names have to match in both. Ron Nixon
is not the same as Ronnie N. Nixon to the
database, even though they might be the same
people. You will have to standardize the
names to get the matches you want.

Finally, always verify, verify, and verify that
the name you have is really the person you think
it is. The join is just the start. Once you have that
the real reporting begins. This not only ensures
that you get the story right, it also protects you
and your paper from a potential lawsuit.

Data: Kansas traffic
accidents, 1990-1999

TRANSPORTATION
Valuable accident data

By Hurst Laviana
The Wichita Eagle

Wayne Louden has been involved in 37
traffic accidents since Jan. 1, 1990, making
him the most accident-prone driver in Kan-
sas. Thomas Spicer has been involved in 27
wrecks, 21 of which resulted in inattentive
driving tickets.

Louden and Spicer were key players in a
series of stories about accident-prone drivers
in Kansas. The series was based on a Kansas
Department of Transportation 1990-1999
database that covered 703,000 traffic acci-
dents involving 1.1 million drivers.

Acquiring the database was a struggle,
but it has proved to be one of the most
valuable data sets in our newsroom. It has
yielded stories about the growing number
of car-deer accidents in the state, the re-
luctance of drivers in the nation's "beltless
belt" to use seatbelts and the fact that ac-
cidents involving police chases doubled in
Kansas during the 1990s. The data also
allows us to quickly generate lists of acci-
dents that have occurred at any intersec-
tion in the state.

Acquiring the database
was a struggle, but it has
proved to be one of the
most valuable data sets in
our newsroom.

But the biggest reader reaction came from
the story about accident-prone drivers. Many
were surprised to learn they were sharing the
roads with 20 Kansas drivers who had 10 or
more accidents in the 1990s. And some of
those drivers had dozens of traffic convic-
tions.

How did they keep driving?

It turned out that the Kansas Division of
Motor Vehicles hasn't been enforcing a law
that allows it to suspend the license of any
driver convicted of three moving violations
in a 12-month period. Instead, the DMV
only takes action after the fifth conviction.

It also turned out that Spicer's inattentive
driving tickets as well as 70,000 other in-
attentive driving citations issued each year
by Wichita police - don't even count against
a driver's record. Inattentive driving is a
ticketable offense in many Kansas cities, but
state law does not prohibit it. So the state
doesn't count it.

Doing the stories

The seeds for the story were planted more
than a year ago when Crime & Safety team
leader Jim Lewers asked KDOT for five years
of accident data. KDOT mailed him copies
of the 1990 through 1996 annual traffic ac-
cident reports.

Lewers tried again, this time asking for a
comprehensive electronic database with de-
tailed information about each accident.
KDOT's response: for $51,710 we could
have the data - minus the drivers' names and
accident locations. KDOT, which wanted 5
cents a line for just more than 1 million lines
of data, said giving us the names and acci-
dent locations could result in the informa-
tion being used against it in court.

KDOT held its ground until February,
when a judge ruled that the agency was im-
properly withholding railroad crossing acci-
dent data from another Kansas newspaper,
the Garden City Telegram. KDOT eventu-
ally gave us the accident data names and
all for $87.11.

Crunching numbers

The file arrived in the newsroom on a
CD-ROM in the form of a 550-megabyte
Microsoft Access database, which included
separate tables for such variables as drivers,
accidents and vehicles. My three-gigabyte
hard drive was no match for that much data,
but we did turn around some quick stories
using pieces of the data.

On March 22, the day the Kansas House
of Representatives approved a bill designed
to cut car-deer accidents by increasing the
number of out-of-state hunting permits, we
sliced the deer accidents from the accidents
table and loaded them into an Excel spread-
sheet.

Excel's Chart Wizard produced an inter-
esting graphic that showed a steady rise in

the number of car-deer accidents. It also re-
vealed a sizable blip every November, when
the males were out seeking mates, and a
smaller blip every May, when females were
out looking for places to give birth.

Our lead: "Cars, trucks and buses crashed
into more than 10,000 deer in 1999, a record
for the state."

Once a bigger hard drive was installed in
my computer, we set out to find the acci-
dent-prone drivers. We needed the extra
room in order to link the tables so we could
track such variables as injuries, fatalities and
accident causes.

A single "group-by" query on the
driver's license field generated a list of
hundreds of Kansans who had been in-
volved in three or more accidents during
the decade. The process was complicated
by the fact that Kansas changed its driver's
license numbering system in the mid-
1990s, so most drivers had two driver's li-
cense numbers.

Other "group-by" queries on the
firstname, lastname and DOB fields turned
up another batch of candidates. We ended
up working with a list of 1,960 drivers who
had five or more accidents in the 1990s.
Their 11,165 accidents left 50 people dead
(including 14 of the accident-prone drivers)
and 5,171 injured.

We eventually decided to focus on the
six drivers who had 12 or more serious acci-
dents during the decade.

Doing the legwork

The next step was to ask KDOT for hard
copies of the accident reports for the six driv-
ers. We also asked local law enforcement
agencies for copies of reports for non-injury
accidents involving less than $500 in dam-
age accidents that aren't reported to the
state.

The written reports, which often had nar-
ratives and diagrams, included more detailed
information than the KDOT database.
Based on this information, reporters inter-
viewed drivers.

The series ran in late September, and a
week later we put the list of drivers with
five or more accidents on our Web site
with a disclaimer noting that the listed
drivers were not necessarily at fault in any
of the accidents.

The only negative reaction from readers
came on the following Wednesday, when a
woman who works at City Hall called to say
our on-line information was wrong — that
she hadn't been involved in six accidents.
When given the dates and locations she re-
treated, then insisted that none of the acci-
dents was her fault.

You can extract bulk data, but it can be
cumbersome. If you can't afford mapping
programs, the CensusCD+Maps product
does a solid job of making thematic maps
(the maps can be exported to ArcView Shape

Costs: CensusCD+Maps (to block group
geography), $500; CensusCD Blocks,
$1,000 for nation; $500 for a single state;
CensusCD 1980, $800 each; $400 for a
single state. The company also has an-
nounced a CensusCD1970, although the
introduction date and pricing weren't avail-
able at press time.

GAMBLING PART I
The math on gambling

By Barnet D. Wolf
Columbus Dispatch

Sometimes the germ of a project begins
with something very common.

"Ohio Hedges Its Bets," a three-day series
on the gambling industry published Oct. 27-
29 in The Columbus Dispatch really started
when a Business News copy editor began pool-
ing money from staff members to drive two
hours to Indiana and buy Powerball tickets.

One writer pointed out that ever since the
multistate lottery games began in states ad-
jacent to Ohio, the staff had rarely pooled its
money for the Ohio Lottery.

What was happening in Columbus, we
thought, probably was happening all across
the state, not only with the lottery but also
with other types of gambling.

Just how big is the legal gambling indus-
try in Ohio and the nation, we wondered,
and what impact have casinos, multistate lot-
teries and other forms of betting in neigh-
boring states had on Ohio?

Setting out to find data on the subject,
we found that some statistics would be easy
to uncover, because they were collected by
the states. A large amount of data also was
compiled by the casino industry.

State lottery

For instance, some computer-assisted re-
search was used to plot the impact of new ew
border-state gambling options to the decline
in Ohio Lottery (www.ohiolottery.com) ticket
sales.

By using the state's own lottery sales num-
bers for several years, and then breaking them
into ZIP codes, the figures could be plotted
on a map.

The Ohio Lottery Commission provided
an electronic database of sales for the past
several years. That database was pretty thor-
ough, with a breakdown of sales by each ven-
dor (gas station, convenience store, etc.).
Each vendor listing had a street address as
well as a city and ZIP code for the business
where tickets are sold.

That made it fairly easy to analyze with
Microsoft Access. We basically grouped and
totaled the sales figures by ZIP code, then
moved that into our ArcView mapping soft-
ware. Once we had a list of sales by ZIP code,
it wasn't tough to map that across Ohio.

The results were compelling: They showed that
the sales decline was much more severe along the
state's borders than in the middle of Ohio.

The state also keeps statistics for bingo
games and horse racing, two other large gam-
bling sectors.

Out-of-state casinos

But other conclusions were much more
difficult to determine, particularly trying to
find out how much money Ohioans gambled
at out-of-state casinos.

The result was a time-consuming exercise
that required searching for financial and
marketing data from public and private lo-
cal, state and national sources, and then ap-
plying old-fashioned math to the numbers.

The findings could not be precise because
of the limitations of the data available, but
the approach produced a reliable estimate.

Fortunately, The Dispatch had the assis-
tance of the Buckeye State Poll, conducted
by Ohio State University in conjunction with
the newspaper, to help serve as a secondary
source to back up some of the numbers.

The questions posed by the poll, con-
ducted in April, looked at the gambling opin-
ions and habits of Ohioans and where — if
anywhere — they gambled.

Gambling revenues

States maintain decent statistics when it
comes to revenues from gambling — after all,
tax money is derived from it — so that's al-
ways a good place to start. Most states also pro-
vide the most basic of their lottery data online.

In a state like Indiana, which has riverboat
gambling, a gaming commission maintains
statistics about slot machines and gaming
tables. West Virginia's devices — video slots
only
are overseen by the Lottery Com-
mission (www.state.wv.us/lottery).

Sometimes the casino information is eas-
ily accessible. For instance, Mississippi's gam-
ing commission (www.msgaming.com) has data
on its Web site that gives the percentage of ca-
sino business from residents of other states.

For the most part, however, states main-
tain data only on the amount of money wa-
gered and lost by individual casinos. Once
you obtain those results, it takes a little leg-

Gambling

work to get numbers for a specific state.

Indiana has riverboat casinos, and its gam-
ing commission (www.state.in.us/gaming/)
reports monthly on the amounts of money
gambled at and won by each casino for slot
machines and table games.

The commission's annual report — also
online — includes the total numbers for the
previous year at each casino.

For all intents and purposes, the amount
won by the casino is the amount that is lost
by its customers.

The result was a time-
consuming exercise that
required searching for
financial and marketing
data from public and
private local, state and
national sources, and then
applying old-fashioned
math to the numbers.

The legwork comes in when you need to
find out how much of that money came from
Ohioans. According to several statisticians and
business experts, the easiest method for determin-
ing those amounts is to get market-share data.

Most of the border-state casinos were will-
ing to divulge the percentage of their cus-
tomers who visit from Ohio. When the mar-
ket share was not provided by a casino, it
was determined from other sources, ranging
from estimates by state officials to a study
that one university conducted by counting
license plates in casino parking lots.

Las Vegas

Calculating the Ohio gambling numbers
from Las Vegas was a bit more complex.

The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors
Bureau (www.lasvegas24hours.com) is a good
source of information on the amount of
money won by casinos in the city, as well as
airplane traffic and visitor profiles.

According to the bureau, 87 percent of
people who visit Las Vegas gamble. Those who
gamble spend an average of $559 per visit.

So, how many of those people are from Ohio?

As with other airports, McCarran Inter-
national Airport (www.mccarran.com) main-
tains statistics regarding the true origin and
destination sites for commercial flight pas-
sengers traveling to and from Las Vegas.

Using these numbers, it's possible to get a
total number of Ohioans coming to Las Ve-
gas via commercial flights (since the number
will be for arrivals and departures, it must be
divided by two to get only arrivals).

By taking the Ohio number against all com-
mercial passengers, it's possible to get a per-
centage number of Ohio passengers that then
can be applied to the charter flight statistics,
in which origin destinations are not calculated.

Add up all those passengers and then
multiply it by .87 (remember, 87 percent of
all visitors gamble). Then multiply that num-
ber by $559 (the average lost per visit) and
the total is the amount that Ohioans lost
gambling.

Since the amount of money lost is about
8 percent of all money bet at the casinos, the
total that Ohioans bet can be ascertained by
multiplying the amount lost by a multiple
in the neighborhood of 12.5 percent.

This calculated number of Ohioans gam-
bling in Las Vegas meshed with the numbers de-
termined in the Buckeye State Poll. Thus the
amount of people gambling at casinos in other
locations can be determined by using the poll.

Adding it all up, The Dispatch was able to
estimate conservatively that Ohioans bet
$11.7 billion and lost $1.8 billion on legal
gambling in 1999. And a large chunk of that
— all that money gambled outside the state
— resulted in tax revenues for states other
than Ohio.

Our approach in tackling the complex topic
of gambling can be applied to other subjects
in which precise data does not exist: With a
little creative thinking, reasonable estimates
based on a solid foundation can be made.

GAMBLING PART II
Tribes and casinos

By David Pace
The Associated Press

A steady drumbeat of news stories
throughout the 1990s documented the rapid
growth of casino gambling on American In-
dian reservations. But lingering questions
remained.

How had the billions of dollars in gam-
bling revenues changed the lives of Indians
on reservations, historically among the
nation's poorest areas? Was gambling solving
the unemployment, poverty and welfare
problems that have plagued reservations? The
Associated Press set out last spring to answer
those questions by gathering data on a broad
range of quality of life variables during the
1990s and then using it to compare reserva-
tions that have casinos with those that don't.

The immediate problem in designing such
a research project was the scarcity of data
collected at the reservation level. The 1990
Census provides a detailed snapshot of reser-
vation life at the beginning of the casino
boom, from education levels to poverty rates
to housing conditions.

But comparative information from the
2000 Census won't be available for several
more years, and the Census Bureau collects
no reservation-level data in the years between
the decennial census. We found only two
other government sources of reservation-level
data: The biennial workforce report compiled
by the Bureau of Indian Affairs from unem-
ployment data provided by tribes, and the
Agriculture Department's Food Distribution
Program on Indian Reservation.

Improvising

We used the BIA workforce reports for
1991 and 1997, and the Agriculture
Department's FDPIR data for 1990 and
1998 as two comparative variables. We also
obtained from the Department of Health and
Human Services a breakdown by race of wel-
fare caseloads in each state. That enabled us
to compare American Indian welfare partici-
pation during the 1990s in states that per-
mit casino gambling with those that don't.

Finally, we asked the Census Bureau's ge-
ography division to create a database of all
the counties that are part of Indian reserva-
tions. That enabled us to use the bureau's
1989 and 1995 county income and poverty
estimates, and its 1990 and 1997 county busi-
ness pattern records, for comparative analysis.

The next major hurdle was dividing tribes
into gaming and non-gaming categories. To
operate a Las Vegas-style casino, the National
Indian Gaming Regulatory Act requires that
a tribe first negotiate a compact with the state.
From the National Indian Gaming Associa-
tion, we obtained a current list of Indian gam-
ing operations and used it to divide tribes
into gaming and non-gaming categories.

We divided them based on the legal defini-
tion, designating as gaming tribes those that op-
erate Class III casinos under compacts with states.
Tribes with small-stakes bingo games were com-
bined, with those that have no gambling op-
erations, into the non-gaming category.

The analysis found that welfare partici-
pation on Indian reservations with casinos
grew far less during the 1990s than on other
reservations. But the historically high unem-
ployment and poverty levels on reservations
changed very little during the 1990s, despite
the influx of gambling money.

The analysis found that
welfare participation on
Indian reservations with
casinos grew far less
during the 1990s than on
other reservations.

Between 1991 and 1997, when the U.S.
unemployment rate dropped from 6.9 per-
cent to 4.9 percent, the unemployment rate
for 146 tribes with casinos declined from 55.9
percent to 52.2 percent, and it actually in-
creased slightly among the 55 tribes with ca-
sinos that opened before 1992. Among the
144 tribes without casinos, the unemploy-
ment rate increased from 43.6 percent in
1991 to 48.3 percent six years later. Simi-
larly, the average poverty rate in counties
where there are gaming tribes declined only

MAPPING
Maps to go

By John Maines
South Florida Sun-Sentinel

There are two truths about buying good
computerized mapping software:
1. Single-user versions are expensive.
2. Internet or Intranet versions are very
expensive.

Three years ago, I decided to see if there
was a way around the high cost of commer-
cial mapping programs. The idea seemed to
make sense: Build an inexpensive, simple
mapping system and pack it with census stats
and anything else we could get our hands on,
especially free public domain data from fed-
eral, state and local government agencies.

We've done it. So can you.

For less than $300, it's possible to build a
fairly powerful program that can be installed
on a PC, a laptop, or launched on the Internet
or company Intranet. At the South Florida
Sun-Sentinel we have test versions running
now. We should have the bugs in time for
the March release of Census 2000 data on
race and Hispanic origin.

To do this, we combined our own soft-
ware know-how with some off-the-shelf map-
ping software designed for people who want
to build their own Geographic Information
Systems (GIS) software. We created a pro-
gram that can be tailored any way we want it
and launched on the Internet or re-deployed
as a stand-alone application for installation a
PC or laptop.

The acid test

The 2000 presidential election provided
a great acid test.

One of the map prototypes was a precinct
map of South Florida, which displays a color-
coded map and spreadsheet-like data grids.
When a user clicks on a precinct, the map
pulls up demographics and voter registration
data for election precincts in the Sun-
Sentinel's circulation area: Broward, Miami-
Dade and Palm Beach counties.

The precinct borders were drawn from
files that we downloaded - for free- from a
Web page run by a state research agency.

So it was pure luck that, when the elec-
tion went to hell, we had a fully-functional
computerized precinct map armed and ready.
We changed the map constantly in the days
following the election, each time reloading
an updated version into our company
Intranet, Sunspot, for use by reporters and
editors.

The first maps we created were simple -
showing who won each precinct. Red for
George W. Bush, blue for Al Gore. When
reports came in that voters in Palm Beach
County had accidentally voted for Pat
Buchanan instead of Al Gore because they
misunderstood the "butterfly ballot," we
mapped out where Buchanan got the most
votes. When we found out that most of the
disqualified votes were in black precincts, we
mapped that out as well, adding new map
layers on top of the old.

Our art department polished up our
graphics for use in the newspaper. Len De
Groot, a senior editorial artist at the Sun-Sen-
tinel, made a terrific map that showed
undervote rates in all 1,754 election precincts
in the three South Florida Counties. It ran
the entire length of a newspaper page, and
covered about one-third the width. (See for
yourself at www.electricalfire.com/
sfprecincts.htm).

Pros and Cons

I'm not saying that newsrooms should toss
the programs that they've already bought and
build a Frankenstein. Arcview, MapInfo,
Maptitude or some other powerful program
will still be the best way to analyze Census
2000. But a simple custom-made system pro-
vides a terrific secondary mapping system for
the newsroom, because it does something
that the big bruisers don't do very well: Cre-
ate dynamic maps on the Intranet that can
be used by even the most non-technical
people.

Consider two popular brands of high-
quality Geographic Information System
(GIS) software.

Arcview 3.2a ($1,195) and MapInfo Pro-
fessional ($1,495) are built for use by one
person per copy of software. That person
builds the maps and distributes them to oth-
ers. Both companies have viewers that can
be used on any PC and are available for free.
But the viewers can't do much more than
zoom in or out of a map and identify what's
on it.

Maps

The viewers also require some effort by
the end user. They need to read the instruc-
tions. That's minimal, but still enough to
send many people running. A good general-
use mapping program needs to be "Web page
simple," allowing the user to learn by push-
ing buttons and generally messing around.

Internet mapping software can be incred-
ibly expensive. One of the best deals on
Internet-based mapping software is $2,995
for Caliper's Maptitude for the Web license.
MapInfo's MapX product line starts at about
$5,000 and ESRI's ArcIMS comes in at
$7,500. Yikes.

THESE TWO MAPS ILLUSTRATE HOW THE
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION "UNDERVOTE" WAS
CONCENTRATED IN BLACK AREAS OF MIAMI-
DADE COUNTY IN FLORIDA. THE FIRST MAP,
RIGHT, SHOWS VOTING PRECINCTS WHERE 8
PERCENT OR MORE OF THE BALLOTS REGISTERED
NO VOTE FOR PRESIDENT. THE SECOND MAP,
PAGE THIRTEEN, SHOWS PRECINCTS WHERE THE
POPULATION IS AT LEAST 50 PERCENT BLACK.
VOTERS LIVING IN THOSE PRECINCTS REPORTED
THAT THEY COULD NOT PUSH THE STYLUS
THROUGH THE PUNCH CARD. ONE THEORY HELD
THAT BECAUSE BLACKS VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY
FOR VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE, A CHAD BUILD-
UP WAS CREATED BENEATH HIS NAME, MAKING IT
DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO PENETRATE THE
PUNCH CARD WITH THE STYLUS.
THESE MAPS WERE CREATED BY THE SOUTH
FLORIDA SUN-SENTINEL USING DATA FROM THE
MIAM-DADE SUPERVISOR OF ELECTIONS.

Those costs are probably far beyond what
most newspapers are willing to spend. So very
low cost was one of five requirements in de-
veloping our software. Here are the other
four:

• It had to be extremely easy to use. The
maps would come with no little or no in-
structions, allowing users to wing it.

• It had to read many kinds of commer-
cial software, such as Arcview shapefiles or
MapInfo's MIF files. It also had to be able to
read data from programs used in most news-
rooms, such as an Excel spreadsheet or an
Access database.

• It had to be available in a desktop ver-
sion, or on the Internet.

• It had to be of "rapid-deployment" na-
ture, producing maps for deadline stories.

Creating a hybrid

Early on, it became clear that the system
would be some sort of hybrid — parts of the
software would be designed by us, and part
would be purchased off-the-shelf. I thought
it would be best for me to build the control
panel that surrounded the map; the compo-
nents that would allow reporters to push buttons
and insert all the parameters for data analysis.

But I really didn't want to build the part
of the program that would actually draw the
map's lines, points and polygons. For that I
needed some sort of "engine."

Maps

Several companies make such software.
There's ESRI's MapObjects, MapInfo's
MapX. But these cost thousands of dollars
to buy and maintain and are really built for
someone who builds high-quality maps for a
living. Newsrooms don't need that degree of
complexity.

One product that looked very good - at
first — was ESRI's MapObjects LT, a
trimmed-down version of MapObjects.
Three years ago, the software only cost $295
and produced some great-looking maps.

But it lacked one very important feature.
There was no easy way to put the names on
roads in your map. It was a critical flaw in
an otherwise good, inexpensive product.
(The newest version of MapObjects LT has
nice labeling capabilities. But it now costs
$1,000).

After abandoning MapObjects LT, we
tried about a half-dozen inexpensive GIS
programs found on the Web. They all
bombed for one reason or another. Some
were too slow. Others couldn't handle
geocoding. Some were just plain junk. Fi-
nally, in a late-night search of the Internet
last February, I discovered a great little pro-
gram called SylvanMaps.

A solution at last

SylvanMaps is sold by Sylvan Accent
(www.sylvanmaps.com), a small company
based in Taos, New Mexico. If you call Syl-
van, there's a pretty good chance that the
guy answering the telephone is Roger Bedell,
the company president.

The software is easy to use and comes
with clearly-written user manuals.
There are three versions.

The first format, SylvanMaps.Net,
is a $249 design-time control for Ac-
tive Server Pages (ASP), the popu-
lar Web page program. Users build
the map in Microsoft Frontpage or
Visual Interdev and launch the fin-
ished product on the Internet. For
another $496 you can buy the sec-
ond version, which has more fea-
tures than the first.

The third version, SylvanMaps
OCX, creates maps in Visual Basic,
Microsoft Access, C++ or Delphi,
and you can install the program on
the Internet or build a desktop pro-
gram. Version three is the most ex-
pensive, $795. But that price allows
you to build unlimited applications,
which can be resold or distributed
to co-workers and sister compa-
nies without fooling around with
annoying royalties or redistribu-
tion fees All three versions are easy
to use.

A beginner can put together a
simple map, and work upward from
there. The better your programming
skills, the more sophisticated the maps
you'll make. A very nice feature is that an
entire map — including the roads, census
tracts, and other features — is built from
data stored in any standard relational da-
tabase, including Microsoft Access, SQL
Server, or Oracle. There's no "hidden" pro-
prietary software.

SylvanMaps can also read or translate

Foster care

obviously does not detract from its useful-
ness. The data quickly answers questions like:
what percentage of black children are in the
system? What percentage of black children
are in group homes? How many children
were removed because of sexual abuse?

Child welfare experts say that the longer
children are in foster care without a perma-
nent placement, the more they are harmed
emotionally. By subtracting dates in
AFCARS, CAR journalists can calculate
median and average time for children in care.
Times in care can then be calculated for ra-
cial groups and sex.

Experts also say that moving children
from foster home to foster home, or repeat-
edly removing them from their natural home,
also injures their psyche. The AFCARS da-
tabase will show, for example, what percent-
age of children have been moved in the sys-
tem two or more times, or removed from
their natural home more than once.

The AFCARS data is required to be kept
and reported by federal law, and states that do
not report the information accurately can be
subject to fines. Data for fiscal years 1995
through 1998 is available through the National
Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect at
Cornell University (www.ndacan.cornell.edu).

maps keeps getting better and cheaper. For

interesting public domain maps on it. These
include hiking trails, bike routes, the paths
of Florida hurricanes over the last 75 years
and the locations of dozens of shipwrecks in
the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico.

We plan to put those on our Intranet.
Shipwrecks aren't as important as elections
or Census 2000. But they're fun. And hey,

federal officials, but because the data is re-
quired under federal law, I requested 1999
and 2000 data from New Jersey DYS and
received it in 48 hours. Our analysis in SPSS,
which led off a five-day series, showed the
state has made little progress on its reform
effort, and it demonstrated worse care for
black children in the system.

Although the dataset at times seems like
it can leap tall buildings in a single bound,
there are limitations. The 1995 and 1996
datasets are not considered as accurate or
complete as later versions.

Some states do report some categories dif-
ferently, so it can be difficult to compare states
to each other in those instances. Although it
will show if a foster child has died, it pro-
vides no information on the deaths. It does
not report maltreatment in foster care, and
it provides no information on prior foster care
episodes.

FIRST VENTURE
Parking tickets

By Jason Callicoat
South Bend Tribune

One of the first stories I wanted to do af-
ter returning from a NICAR Boot Camp last
spring involved linking a database of local
parking tickets with a database of weather
and climate information. I wanted to see
whether there was a correlation between bad-
weather days and the number of parking tick-
ets handed out.

This was a story idea that was mentioned
as an example during one of the boot camp
presentations.

I decided to look at data from Jan. 1, 1998,
to as close to the present as I could get.

Weather data

The weather database was fairly easy to
get. The National Weather Service already
had a table of each month's weather data
saved as a text file. They maintained it this
way so they could print it each month in a
weather newsletter.

The weather service had about 18 months'
worth of weather data saved on a disk, which
they let me borrow – for free – if I promised
to mail it back to them.

There was some prohibition on them giv-
ing away data (they were supposed to charge
for it), but the person I was dealing with was
very accommodating. I couldn't copy the disk,
or have the disk, but I could "borrow" it if I
mailed him back the original.

For the months before the weather ser-
vice began storing the data electronically, he
gave me the newsletters in which they pub-
lished the final data. Again, I couldn't have
copies of these, but I could take them all
back to the office with me if I mailed him
back the originals.

I copied the text files for each month that
they had saved on disk, transferring them into
an Access database. Then I typed in about 12-
months' worth of daily data from the weather
service's paper newsletters. I only had about
10 fields, so it didn't take that long.

Parking tickets

The parking tickets database was a little
harder to get, but I used some of the tricks I
learned at boot camp.

The clerks in the city's Ordinance Viola-
tions Department said their software was 15
years old and not compatible with Microsoft.

They offered to make me a printout of all
the parking tickets from the past two and a
half years (roughly 50,000 of them), but it
would take several days of print time for their
dot-matrix printer to finish with that job.

I asked who was in charge of backing up
their data every night, and they gave me the
name of the information technology director.

I got in to see him fairly easily, and he looked
through the backup files and found one for park-
ing tickets. He had no problem with burning me
a CD of the file for free. It was stored in DBase
format, which is easily converted into Access.

But when I got it converted and reorga-
nized the data, I found it was a couple years
old and didn't have the tickets that matched
up with my weather data. When I went back
that afternoon, the IT director found the
right backup file and burned another CD.
It had about three years' worth of tickets,
up through the tickets that were given the
previous day.

On to analysis

I linked the tables by date and found that
the 10 percent of the days with the most tick-
ets were generally nice-weather days, and the
10 percent of the days with the fewest tick-
ets were generally bad-weather days.

The story ended up taking about six or
seven weeks to complete, although I was pulled
away from it several times to do daily stories.
The CAR portion of it took about two-thirds
of that time.

The parking tickets database also proved
useful, beyond the original story, because it
listed license-plate numbers and registered
owners of all the cars (tens of thousands of
them) that had gotten a parking ticket in South
Bend in the past several years. I ended up do-
ing a few searches for another reporter who
had a group of license plates he wanted to trace.

Also, while working with the parking tick-
ets database, I found quite a few government
cars listed. I ran a query to pull them all out,
and I found that almost none of the tickets
on these government cars had been paid.

The cars belonged to a group of armed
forces recruiters who had offices down the
street from our building.

Story #: 14251.
KOMU-TV (Columbia,
Mo.) Reporter Jack Dolan
found that the odds of
getting a parking ticket in
Columbia on a day with
even the slightest amount
of precipitation (.01
inches or more) are about
half what they are on a
perfectly sunny day, and
the odds plummet as the
weather worsens. Nov. 5,
1997.

battle between downtown
employees and the local
police department over
illegal parking; describes
the lengths to which
violators go to avoid
tickets and includes a

of the biggest offenders
and the spots most often
ticketed, March 27, 1994.

Parking tickets

Together, they owed more than $4,000
in tickets and late fees. I did some checking,
and it turned out that the city had issued a
legal opinion that was preventing Ordinance
Violations from collecting on these tickets.

The weather service had
about 18 months' worth
of weather data saved on
a disk, which they let me
borrow - for free - if I
promised to mail it back
to them.

The opinion said that armed forces re-
cruiters could not be taken to small claims
court for unpaid parking tickets the way any-
one else would be. That's because it would
involve one branch of the government suing
a larger branch of the government, which is
prohibited by the Supremacy Clause of the
U.S. Constitution.

Eventually, these recruiters had figured out
nothing ever happened if they failed to pay
their parking tickets. (They preferred to park
on the street outside their offices, even though
the government rented parking spaces for them
in a garage right across the street. But the spaces
were on the 6th floor, and the recruiters didn't
like driving all the way up there.)

porters, tech-support staff and librarians. Even
so, she publishes just once a quarter because
she "found it impossible to find the time to
produce it more often than that,” indicating
just how time-consuming a newsletter can be.

See how long it takes to produce your first
newsletter to gauge how often you'd like to
issue your newsletter.

Let's face it. Writing about Excel can be
boring. But if your newsletter is fun to read,
more people will get through it. Even fun
tempts, the city stopped trying to collect the
money for the recruiters' tickets.

I wrote a story about it, and the recruiters
were all very contrite when I talked to them.
The Marines sent a colonel up from India-
napolis to pay $1,000 worth of their tickets
a day or so after I interviewed the recruiters.
Some of the other recruiters paid smaller
amounts of their tickets, as well.

Tips for others

I'd say the parking tickets/weather story
is a good one to do as a "first venture." The
National Weather Service was not at all pos-
sessive with its data, and the people I dealt
with there actually seemed pleased that someone
was taking interest in their work. They went out
of their way to make their data available.

In South Bend, the records of our park-
ing tickets are maintained by the Ordinance
Violations Department. It's not a city depart-
ment we report on very regularly, which
seemed to work to my advantage.

They hadn't been burned and didn't seem
suspicious at all, just a little curious. They
didn't react badly when I gave somewhat
vague answers to their questions of what I
wanted the data for. The only hurdles with
this department were technical: working
around their 15-year-old software and iden-
tifying the correct back-up file.

After returning from NICAR's Boot
Camp, I found these stories were a good way
to get my feet wet with CAR. I'd recommend
similar stories to anyone as a "first venture."

categories. And if we want to do stories on seg-
regation or diversity that talk about changes
since 1990, we need a way to properly tabu-
late those who count themselves as multiracial
- a so-called "bridge" between the two datasets.

Before I suggest a solution, I should has-
ten to add that we won't always want to turn
the 2000 racial/Hispanic categories back into
the 1990 version. The new categories are a
much richer trove of information about the
state of racial interaction in this country, and
deserve plenty of attention in their own right.
(Look, for instance, at doing stories about
which racial/ethnic combinations are most
and least common. Or focus on age groups,
where I suspect you'll see that increasing
numbers of multi-racial youth can be con-
sidered direct evidence of the fading racial
and cultural prejudices of their parents and
grandparents.)

Some of the most
important uses of census
racial and ethnic data will
be to monitor progress
towards racial fairness in
such matters as hiring,
voting, lending, access to
education and health
care, etc.

With that said, I'll further note that some
places won't need to worry much about us-
ing a bridge. For instance, the 1998 dress
rehearsal census in 11 South Carolina coun-
ties found that only about one percent of the
population considered themselves multiracial.
No matter how those in the multiracial col-
umn are parceled out in places like that, they
won't change the overall mix significantly.

But lots of other places - like Sacramento,
where fully 5 percent of the population chose
multiracial status in the dress rehearsal cen-
sus
will need to make some decisions
about how best to treat those folks when com-
paring the 2000 numbers to 1990. For what
it's worth, here are some suggestions, in in-
creasing order of complexity:

Ignore them

If your local multiracial population is a tiny
part of the whole, perhaps a fraction of a per-
cent, you could pretty safely just drop them
from any calculations. Simply calculate your
percentages using the "Race X alone" columns,
divided by the total of those "Race X alone"
columns. You will need to add 2000's "Ha-
waiian and Other Pacific Islander" and "Asian"
categories to be equivalent to 1990's "Asian and
Pacific Islander" category, but that's easy. The
results you get will be within a few tenths of a
percent of what you would get with the more
troublesome methods suggested below.

Parcel out

Okay, you're queasy at the idea of just ig-
noring them, even though their numbers are
very small. Instead, figure the percentage each
single-race category is of the total popula-
tion, then allocate the multiracial population
using the same proportions. For example, if
your population is 100,000 Whites, 10,000
Blacks, and 1,000 folks of two or more racial
backgrounds, then treat your population as
100,900 Whites and 10,100 Blacks. Like the
"ignore them" strategy, this only works com-
fortably in a place where the multiracial
population is quite small.

Count races, not people

Paul Overberg of USA Today suggests this
method of looking at the racial mix of an
area. You won't get this in the March data
release, but later census products will have
tables counting the number of people who
claim each race at least in part, labeled "Race
X alone or in combination with other races."
The total will add up to more than the ac-
tual population, thanks to the multiple
counting of people with multiple racial back-
grounds. But calculating the percentage each
race is of the total count by race would be
easy and informative. I'm less convinced,
though, that this will produce a good way to
compare 2000 to 1990.

Race problems

One race answer

The very best bridge method is to allo-
cate them based on how they would answer
if they could choose only one race. For in-
stance, if 90 percent of people who identi-
fied themselves as "White and Black" would
identify themselves as "Black" if only one
choice could be made, then you simply ap-
ply those various percentages to the various
multiracial categories.

Problem is, no one knows what those per-
centages are. Learning them will require ei-
ther a massive survey far too expensive for
any news organization to undertake, or - the
real answer - access to individual census re-
turns. The good news is that the Census
Bureau says it will tackle the problem, by
comparing a large sample of 2000
multicultural returns to what those same
people answered to the race/Hispanic origin
questions back in 1990. The bad news is that
it may be another couple of years before they
get around to it. So, on to another solution.

Cut them into pieces

Remember the story of King Solomon,
who suggested a baby be divided in half so
that both mothers who claimed the child
could have a share? The bridge method I ul-
timately favor uses the same, though hope-
fully less messy, approach. You take each of
the 126 possible race/Hispanic origin catego-
ries, cut them up into their single-race com-
ponents, and then allocate those pieces into
the correct 1990 categories. For example, 100
people of Black and Asian background would
be counted as 50 Blacks and 50 Asians.

There is a further refinement, though, that
I think is needed. Some of the most impor-
tant uses of census racial and ethnic data will
be to monitor progress towards racial fair-
ness in such matters as hiring, voting, lend-
ing, access to education and health care, etc.
Clearly, for those purposes someone who is
of mixed parentage would be considered to
be of minority background even if one par-
ent was White. For that reason, I argue that
100 people of Black and White background
should be counted as 100 Blacks. My rea-
soning falls in line with a federal directive
that persons of mixed White-minority par-
entage should be counted as minorities in all
instances where that label offers protections
or benefits.

My method is pretty simple in concep-
tion, though damned ugly in execution.
Here, for example, is how you can use the
variable names from the PL94-171 files that
will be released in March to calculate the
1990 equivalent of Latin Blacks:

Restaurant inspections

By Rick Linsk
St. Paul Pioneer Press

It took a strong stomach to successfully
pull off our "Restaurant Reservations" series
(Oct. 23-27, 2000) — not to mention oodles
of computer-assisted reporting resources and
considerable tenacity.

First, a disclosure: We didn't invent this
wheel. Restaurant inspections are a longtime
staple of investigative reporting. Television
stations in the Twin Cities and other cities,
sometimes aided by hidden cameras, have
reported filthy or unsafe practices. Newspa-
pers in Toronto, San Jose, Charlotte and St.
Louis, among others, have also examined res-
taurants. Our series built on the techniques
of our predecessors, and in some ways went
even farther.

We expected to be
finished by the end of
1999. But slow-moving
govemment
bureaucracies, dirty data,
and other factors would
confound our timetable.

The editors and reporters central to the
project - Projects Editor Jeff Kummer, Food
Editor Kathie Jenkins, restaurant beat reporter
Gita Sitaramiah and myself, a member of the
investigative team — began in mid-summer
1999 with several fundamental questions. We
wondered whether area restaurants were gen-
erally following or failing the rules; whether
the government's system of overseeing restau-
rants was working; and whether the average
consumer had any way to distinguish between
the safe and unsafe, the clean and unclean.

We expected to be finished by the end of
1999. But slow-moving government bureau-
cracies, dirty data, and other factors would
confound our timetable.

Getting the records

From the outset, we faced an obstacle: Frag-
mentation of oversight. Across the nation, res-
taurants are inspected by a patchwork of state,
county and local government health agencies.
In Minnesota, ultimate responsibility rests with
the state Department of Health, but the de-
partment delegates its powers to dozens of
counties and cities. In the end, we studied res-
taurant inspections by MDH and five local
agencies in the Twin Cities that were willing
and able to give us computerized records.

Some government agencies resisted our
request for inspection data and only relented
after official requests, meetings, and follow-
up phone calls and e-mails. Even then, some
took weeks or months to provide the records.

The most notorious agency was the state
Department of Health, which oversees food
establishments in Dakota County and most
of outstate Minnesota. MDH failed to pro-
vide complete inspection data for six months,
and only after the Pioneer Press noticed that
a computer file initially provided by the de-
partment was incomplete. The department
also took two months to provide computer
records about foodborne outbreaks, and only
after "sanitizing" the records of information
that could identify victims. (More on that
below.)

In one county, officials gave us the com-
puter data from inspectors' portable comput-
ers, but said their contract with a software
vendor prevented them from providing any
background on how to read the data.

Analyzing the data

As the old saying goes, be careful what
you ask for, because you just might get it.
That's how we felt after the various agencies'
data arrived. The reason: Regulatory agen-
cies use computers to help keep track of in-
spection schedules and compliance, not sift
trends from the data as we wanted to do. The
six databases had several different formats.
Some were missing records. Others were lit-
tered with duplicate records. One county had
only entered about half of all restaurant vis-
its into the computer system - the "bad" in-
spections, leaving the better visits docu-
mented only in hundreds of paper files.

St. Paul's data came from an ancient com-
puter system (finally replaced in the middle
of our project) with some confusing twists -

among them, taking violations by restaurants
long since out of business and attributing
them to the building's current occupant. St.
Paul also was unable to give us a list of res-
taurants issued tickets, something other agen-
cies were able to do.

Most of our tasks had to be multiplied by
six — for instance, six sets of queries for the
worst and best restaurants; six sets of phone
calls to officials to request paper records, con-
firm our findings, ask about "good guys," and
other needs; six different sets of preparation mate-
rials for interviews with officials, and so forth.

One of the dilemmas we wrestled with was
how to analyze the inspection scores. There's a
strong argument that scores can be mislead-
ing. A restaurant can get a mediocre score, say
in the low 80s, for a bunch of minor violations
that involve "floor, walls and ceilings" but not
food safety. On the other hand, a restaurant
can get a score of 90 while committing one or
two really gross violations, like improper food
temperatures and cross-contaminating cooked
food with bacteria from raw food -- things that
can make people sick.

So from early on, to avoid this contro-
versy, we never contemplated actually pub-
lishing the averages, or scores from a given
year, etc. Instead, we made plans to count
up and rank restaurants based on how many
"critical" violations they received.

In total, we found Twin Cities restaurants
had violated food-safety rules more than
130,000 times from 1995 to mid-1999, in-
cluding more than 20,000 violations that

slightly, from 18.2 percent to 18.4 percent.
In the U.S. as a whole, the poverty rate in-
creased from 12.8 percent to 13.8 percent
during that period.

To understand why gambling revenues
weren't having more of an impact, we tried
to determine where the money was going.
We filed a Freedom of Information Act re-
quest with the National Indian Gaming
Commission - the agency with regulatory
oversight of the Indian gambling industry
asking for a revenue breakdown of the casinos.
government agencies classify as "critical" be-
cause they can make diners sick. We also
obtained a state database of foodborne ill-
ness outbreaks, many of which had never
come to light before. As for enforcement, we
pieced together agencies' records - sloppy in
most cases - and found penalties against vio-
lators were rare, even when they were proven
to have made people sick.

spreadsheet, all your requests for information
— when, to whom, how officials responded,
and where things stand. It gets harder to keep
track as the weeks and months go by, and
multiple requests pile up.

To locate victims, consider such public
records sources as lawsuits, foodborne illness
complaints, death certificates, hospital dis-
charge records, even letters to the editor.

Think early, and if possible decide early, how
to document and illustrate your findings re-
garding specific restaurants. We began by look-
ing at bests and worsts, but had concerns about
whether the data would be accurate, timely and
complete enough. Late in the game, we shifted
gears and wound up publishing inspection re-
sults for the most popular restaurants (as mea-
sured by the Zagat Survey).

The commission refused to release finan-
cial data on individual casinos, saying it was
proprietary information. But it did classify
the casinos into six different revenue catego-
ries, from those making more than $100
million a year to those making less than $3
million a year, and provided a cumulative
revenue total for each category.

We then used the tribal enrollment num-
bers in the workforce reports from the Bu-
reau of Indian Affairs to calculate the actual
number of Indians belonging to tribes in each
of the six categories.
