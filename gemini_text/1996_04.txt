Statistics

Uplink update

Congratulations to the Orange County Register staff, who won the Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting for "Fertility Fraud," and to Raleigh News & Observer re­porters Pat Stith, Joby Warrick and Melanie Sill, who won the Pulitzer Prize for public service for "The Price of Pork," a look at the health risks of waste disposal in the hog industry. The next issue of Uplink will feature these and other contest winners and finalists who used computer-assisted reporting.

This issue of Uplink looks at statistics. Phil Meyer, author of "The New Precision Journalism," begins by giving an overview of statistical techniques and their use for journalists. Neill Borowski of the Philadelphia Inquirer provides instructions for doing economic analysis on the fly, and NICAR's Natalya Shulyakovskaya demon­strates how to parse using Excel.

Also check out our new data offerings from the NICAR library. We are providing the most com­plete and up-to-date FEC data available, including data you can't get online, in monthly updates.

Stats add muscle to computer-assisted reporting

Feel the power

By Stan Dorsey
NICAR Staff

In the fast-moving world of com­puter-assisted reporting, journalists each day defy the widely held notion that reporters and numbers don't mix. They break down databases and computer record layouts with virtual ease, using programs such as FoxPro, Paradox, Ac­cess and Excel.

Just when it seems like they've done it all, something new comes along — something like statistics.

The use of statistics for research and analysis in the social sciences and in most medical fields has been going on for years. But it is a tool that is relatively unfamiliar to journalists, even those who are savvy in the general applications of CAR.

That does not have to be the case, says Philip Meyer, author of "The New Precision Journalism" and William Rand Kenan, Jr., professor of journalism at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The power of statistical analysis can be tapped by any journalist who is willing to learn, Meyer says.

Both Meyer and John Bare, a media consultant who works closely with Meyer and specializes in the use of sta­tistics, agree that the first step in inter­preting statistical analyses is to under­stand the basic model on which it based the linear model.

It's a linear world

"Understanding the linear model," Bare says, "is the key to understanding other tools like linear regression or lo­gistic regression. You should always know it first."

The linear model, Meyer says, "is based on the idea that many relation­ships in life fit a straight line, even when they don't seem to at first."

One way to conceptualize the linear model is to think back to the old days of high school or college algebra. On a

SAS vs. SPSS

Playing with the big guns

By Steve Doig
The Miami Herald

If you can touch-type your way around a spreadsheet, and you speak fluent SQL to your database pro­gram, it's time to add a new power tool to your CARpentry workbench: One of the major statistical analysis software packages, either SAS or SPSS.

Here's where I'd like to tell you that, despite what you've heard, SAS and/or SPSS are cheap and easy to master. I'd like to, but I'd be telling a lie.

Actually, they're damned expen­sive, and they can do things you'll have trouble pronouncing (say "par­tial canonical correlation analysis"

basic graph with a y axis and an x axis, the linear model posits that as the x, or indepen­dent variable, changes, and so changes the y ,or dependent variable. In other words, the amount that y increases or decreases is directly dependent on changes in the x variable.

Consider the real life application offered by Meyer, which deals with state SAT score aver­ages.

"The scores from each state would be di­rectly dependent upon how many students took the test. The fewer students who take it, generally that means a higher score, and vice versa," Meyer says.

The degree to which a comparison fits a straight line is referred to as a linear correla­tion. So, for example, there is a strong linear correlation between the temperature outside and how much you sweat.

Linear correlation leads to the discussion of the first and simplest type of statistical analy­sis journalists use. It is called linear regression and follows the exact concept explained by the linear model. Regression refers to the relation­ship between two or more correlated variables.

Meyer says that a good use of linear regres­sion is for dealing with economics. It allows you to make a prediction about something based on information you are sure about. For example, it is known that when the interest rate increases, the demand for housing decreases. Based on this linear correlation, we should be able to predict a rise or fall in the demand for housing by simply looking for a trend in inter­est rates.

Logistic regression

A more complicated application of statis­tics is called logistic regression. The main difference between linear and logistic regres­sion is in the nature of the x and y (independent and dependent) variables.

In linear regression the two variables are continuous, meaning that there is a great range in their potential value. In the example of the SAT scores, the dependent variable can range from 400 to 1600, and the independent vari­able can be any number of students.

In logistic regression, however, at least one of the variables involved is referred to as a categorical or binary variable. In stark contrast to continuous variables, categorical variables have dichotomous values such as male/female, yes/no or dead/alive.

Logistic regression still involves finding a relationship between two or more factors, but it allows you to do it in a far more powerful, meaningful way.

"The beauty of logistic regression," Meyer says, "is that you are able to take several indepen­dent variables and use them to estimate the odds that your dependent variable will be one or zero."

Using the different independent variables, Meyer says, enables you to have control over certain variables that you ordinarily may not.

A case where this is most evident is in medical reporting. Very often reporters are interested in investigating mysterious death rates (death is a categorical variable) at a particular medical insti­tution. Using logistic regression allows them to control for certain independent factors such as the patient's age, level of income, health history or insurance coverage.

Controlling for these factors in a comparison of death rates has the effect of leveling the playing field for all the institutions being examined. This is precisely what New York Times reporter Josh Barbanel attempted to do in his investigation of the unusually high rate of newborn deaths at certain New York City hospitals.

Multiple regression

Multiple regression is very similar to logistic regression with the exception that you are able to include more than one dependent variable.

Many education beat reporters have found this technique particularly valuable, Meyer says, when attempting to measure the efficiency of particular schools in a district by using graduate rates and test scores of students.

In these studies, variables such as the amount of money per pupil and the level of income per family can be controlled for. Dave Davis of The Plain Dealer+ found this out when he embarked upon a study of the test scores for 600 Ohio public schools.

Davis and three other education reporters con­trolled for variables such as poverty, parents' education level, and the percentage of renters in a district as a measure of how often families move. Their study found that these factors these account

Looking at police stats

It ought to be a crime

By Bill Bell
Missouri School of Journalism

Last Christmas, Jeff Green of The Oakland Press in Pontiac, Mich., learned an important lesson: Do it yourself.

In the Christmas to New Year's lull, Green wrote a series of stories on growth and crime with fellow reporter Kathy Gray. Green got the jump on his competitors by circumventing the FBI and going straight to his local police depart­ments.

Over the course of several weeks, Green asked about 60 law enforcement agencies in Oakland County for their tallies in eight crime categories: murder, rape, robbery, assault, bur­glary, larceny, auto theft and arson. Green pooled his numbers with reporters from a local televi­sion station.

Using his IBM laptop, Green put together his own database on Excel 5.0 and Fox Pro 2.6. He estimated it took seven hours to clean up and track down errors in the data. Green found that many data discrepancies stemmed from the struc­ture of the police department.

Overall, Green said, his data was cleaner and more accurate than the crime statistics from the FBI. "It's better than the FBI database because the FBI has blanks and stuff," Green said. "If you are going to start comparing Community A to Community B, you better go to Community A and Community B."

Green also researched the correlation be­tween commercial growth and crime. He used data on property tax values from the Oakland County Planning Department.

Green, a science, demographics and envi­ronment reporter with a background in statis­tics, said he is planning to follow up the series by seeing if the number of police officers is keeping up with community growth. Research last year showed the fire department increas­ingly understaffed.

Green advised reporters to look at the statis­tical significance of the data. Reporters are notorious for writing stories about startling numbers without looking at the whole statisti­cal picture, he said. Small communities may experience a large percentage increase in crime but still have relatively low crime rates.

"A real pitfall in these type of stories is paying too much attention to the change and not to the actual numbers," Green said. "A lot of places with the fastest growing crime rates were also still the safest communities."

for nearly 60 percent of the difference in test scores between districts.

But more importantly, they were able to target schools that were not performing up to the standards which Davis' demographic analysis predicted they should. Some schools, on the other hand were performing well above pre­dicted levels, despite difficult social circum­stances.

Reliability analysis

A final tool, which Meyer says he finds very useful in making his stories relevant to their readers, is reliability analysis. It is based on the principle of intercorrelation, which measures the degree to which several different items mea­sure the same thing.

This is particularly helpful in doing surveys.

"Reliability analysis allows you to take sev­eral different survey questions and find out how related they are to each other," he says. "Once you do that, you can compute a single number, which expresses your outcome."

By expressing complete survey results with only one figure, reporters can easily compare results from different segments of the popula­tion without drowning the reader in numbers.

Regardless of which method reporters de­cide is best for their story, the use of statistics is not as scary as it may sound. But Davis is quick to note that it is only part of the process.

"It's great for getting numbers crunched," he says, "but you still have to put everything in a relevant context for your readers."

three times), much less readily understand how to use.

Software with strength

So why would I recommend that CAR specialists who already are happy with pro­grams like Excel and FoxPro begin learning such powerful software? For that very reason — the power.

As you might expect, both SAS and SPSS are loaded with a huge array of functions for doing sophisticated statistical analyses. With them, you can do just about anything from simple crosstabs and frequency tables up through multiple linear regression and on to such exotica as cluster, factor and discriminant analyses.

For the past six years, most of my serious CAR work has been done with SAS. (I've also experimented with SPSS.) In that time, I've used perhaps 10 percent of SAS's capabilities. And I'm well aware there is considerable dan­ger in all that power. Without a solid ground­ing in statistics, which I'm still struggling to acquire, you can unknowingly commit all sorts of career-threatening errors. As someone once noted, statistics can be made to say anything if you torture them enough.

Built for speed

But I recommend SAS or SPSS for much more than their statistical capabilities. Most important to CAR folks, both programs are filled with features designed to easily handle the myriad messy ways we receive our data. Signed packed decimals? Japanese date for­mats? Octals? Hierarchical data layouts? Thou­sands of variables per record? SAS or SPSS eat these like candy.

And they're built for speed. Recently, I was working with 24 fixed-length ascii files total­ing about 19 megabytes. Microsoft Access 2.0 needed a total of 124 seconds to import one 27,000-record file and produce a simple crosstab. It took SAS just 14 seconds to do the same thing on the same 486-66 computer. In fact, SAS batch-imported all 24 files in the time it took Access to import one.

There isn't room here to do a full and fair comparison of all the features of SAS and SPSS. But based on my experience, here's the short version: SPSS 7.0 for Win95 costs less than SAS and is easier to begin using, thanks to a very user-friendly, point-and-click interface. The SPSS basic module lists at $695, which includes most of the statistical procedures and graphics that you're likely to need. For hundreds of dollars more, you can buy advanced modules that handle such problems as analysis of time series data.

SAS, on the other hand, can't even be pur­chased. Instead, you pay an annual license fee (which entitles you, though, to the frequent up­grades.) I use Base SAS and the SAS/Stat module, which together cost $1,935 the first year and $870 each year thereafter. Other modules, such as Graphics and GIS, add to the cost.

And while SAS has a nice point-and-click working environment, you have to write pro­grams to do the actual work. In SPSS, the inter­face does the programming for you, at least for the easier stuff. (However, don't be intimidated by programming. It's like learning a new language, but it looks a lot like English and has a vocabulary of only a few dozen words.)

And the winner is ...

So why not just get cheaper-and-easier SPSS and forget about SAS? For one thing, SAS offers a somewhat wider range of the data import and manipulation functions you might need someday. That's why SAS is a widely used standard in thousands of big commercial and government data operations, such as the Bureau of the Census. In fact, chances are SAS is used in your own business-side computer shop; that's where I dis­covered it.

An even better reason for choosing SAS is SAS-L, a very active e-mail list of SAS users around the world. Countless times, SAS-L ex­perts have given me fast solutions — including fully written programs — to data problems I've tossed to the list.

For my money (well, actually the Herald's money), the considerable expense and steeper learning curve of SAS is more than outweighed by its vast functionality and large corps of glad-to-help-you users.

In sum, using SAS or SPSS for routine CAR problems may seem a little like using a construc­tion crane to plant flowerpots. But when the day comes that you need to do some really heavy data-lifting, you'll be glad you have either one.

A look at widgetmaking

Economic analysis on the fly

By Neill A. Borowski
The Philadelphia Inquirer

When it comes to local economies, percep­tions may not be realities.

Community leaders may THINK their re­gion is a leader in computer manufacturing, oг financial services or other industries. But we don't really know this simply by looking at employment totals. Enter the "location quo­tient" û a well-worn tool in regional economic analysis. We recently used this statistic to see just how important computer industries are to the Philadelphia area.

Location quotients are fairly simple to com­pute. They show the concentration of employ­ment in a region compared to the United States.

The quotients, which are measures of con­centration, also can be used with total payroll dollars (from County Business Patterns) rather than employment. Or they can be used to calcu­late the concentration of one population (race, etc.) compared with the nation (or other areas).

Let's look at widgetmaking. The quotient calculation first requires calculating what per­centage widget employment is in this metro and the percentage widgetmaking is nationally.

If there are 10,000 widget workers and 100,000 workers in a metro, the percent is 10 percent. If there are 5 million widget workers nationally and the total workforce is 100 mil­lion, 5 percent of the national workforce is in widgetmaking. Just by looking at the data (10 percent vs. 5 percent) you can see widget em­ployment is twice as concentrated in the metro than in the nation as a whole.

You convey this with another quick calcula­tion: (10 percent/5 percent)*100 = 200. This is the location quotient, or index, of the metro, with the U.S. average = 100.

With a spreadsheet or database manager you can quickly compute the quotients for all sec­tors in your local economy. If your quotients are around 100 (cut some slack for data reporting error), the concentration is equal to the national concentration. If your quotient is, say, 50, then your concentration is half that of the nation.

We ran a bar chart with the Philadelphia metro vs. San Jose in several computing and other industries. A broken line through the charts marked U.S.=100.

Why use index numbers when you could run a.table showing 10 percent and 5 percent? For widgetmaking, you could. But what about ce­ramic-plated widgetmaking? The numbers are 0.0043 percent vs. 0.0021 percent. Still twice as concentrated, but a lot more difficult to under­stand in percentages (the index would be 205). In general, the percentages will be relatively small. By the way, round the index numbers; don't use decimals, which serve to confuse.

Of course, there are assumptions and prob­lems with this. I used only non-agricultural businesses. Government employment wasn't a factor. If the metro is small enough, it could have a high concentration (index of 200 or more) but actually have only a few thousand employees in that industry. Or, the employment might be all at one company. (However, the County Business Patterns will suppress employment and payroll data if there are only one or two employers in a given industry.) Some purists might also say you have to subtract your metro from the nation before making the national computations.

You don't have to use County Business Pat­terns. Your regional Bureau of Labor Statistics office can supply establishment employment (series 790) statistics. Or you could use data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (U.S. Commerce Department). I chose the Patterns because they are seen as a pretty accurate mea­sure. Another measure is the series of economic censuses from the U.S. Census Bureau (they're done every five years in years ending in "2" and "7"; the data for 1992 came out last fall).

Some possibilities:

• If agriculture is big in your area, use the Census Bureau's Census of Agriculture to com­pute location quotients (dairy revenues in your metro vs. other leading dairy metros).

• If the federal government is talking of more cuts, determine how concentrated federal em­ployment is in your metro. Is it much more concentrated than the nation as a whole?

• Is upscale retail hot in your area? Use the Census of Retail Trade to compute the relevant location quotients.

• For those fortunate enough to have motor vehicle databases, is there a concentration of luxury cars in your county vs. other counties?

Practice your skills on the sport that loves statistics: baseball. You can look at baseball player's salaries and performance figures. Or, if you prefer, see an example of a simple regression on the taste of cheddar cheese, and look at how to use a scatterplot to probe the history of Olympic winners. That's just one of the offerings from Carnegie Mellon University's Statistics Department. A great resource for reporters just starting is the Data and Story Library, a collection of real-life ways that experts crunched data.

CAR trips: First adventures

Exposing 'Little White Lies'

By Aaron Elstein
Illinois Times

Aaron Elstein attended NICAR Bootcamp in January. In "Little White Lies," one of his first CAR stories, Elstein built his own data­base of state "work-force reports" and looked at whether Illinois lives up to its affirmative action standards.

Every state agency in Illinois is supposed to file a "work-force report" with the secretary of state's office by Jan. 1. The reports detail the past year's hirings and promotions and catego­rizes employees by race, gender and salary level. I had written about the issue a year earlier, but this year, I had the benefit of FoxPro.

There are almost 100 state agencies, com­missions and boards, and 65 of them had filed their reports. The records were not available electronically, so I typed in the information I wanted into about 20 different fields. I wanted to look at percentages of minorities in every agency, and at how salaries for minorities compared from agency to agency and track hiring and promotion trends. It took about three days to enter this using my own Mac laptop for the project.

Affirmative action is a hot issue, and state employment is always a lively topic around Spring­field, where one-third of the city's population works for the government. There's a law on the books saying each state agency's work force should reflect the state's population as a whole (which is 25 percent nonwhite), but the groups who represent minority employees believe the state has been lax in enforcing this.

My data analysis revealed that, in some ways, the state has done pretty well hiring minorities and women: 23 percent of the work force is minority, and Illinois Gov. Jim Edgar has ap­pointed some women and minorities as cabinet directors.

Despite that, the number of minorities work­ing for the government has actually declined since his administration started five years ago. And right away, the analysis showed just how few minorities can get a job outside the urban social

Riding the A-train

By Jim Morris
CNN

Jim Morris attended the NICAR Bootcamp in January.

Like a bolt of lightning, it struck. It was my first day at NICAR Bootcamp, and I had just had a revelation of Biblical proportions: I really could use this stuff.

I was working on a railroad safety story, and I was anxious to use my new skills on my return to Atlanta. I got on the phone with the systems operator at the Federal Railroad Ad­ministration. I knew the FRA maintained sev­eral databases on train safety, and I wanted to know how I could access the information.

I was expecting a bureaucratic nightmare, but what I found was computer nirvana. The FRA maintains a page on the Department of Transportation's website. The page includes ftp versions of all of its safety databases for 1990-95.

First, I downloaded the file layout and code sheets. Then I downloaded the databases. When I opened the first file, voila, nothing. Something was wrong with the layout.

I began experimenting with the layout values and quickly discovered that things didn't add up. My record lengths were all wrong. The layout sheet listed fields that just didn't exist! After much fussing, I finally got it all worked out. Until I checked the codesheet.

Ahh, the codesheet. Not even close to reality. I got back on the horn with the FRA and had them fax me a copy of the incident/accident report sheet from which the data is entered. Having the report form saved me from near insanity.

By now, my eyes were burning, my fingers cramped. But I finally was ready to ask some questions. I wanted to know where the most deadly railroad crossing in the United States was. So I asked the computer to count the number of accidents at each highway crossing. That was a mistake. As I've since realized (I feel stupid admitting I didn't catch this right away), high­ways often cross railroad tracks more than once.

We've come a long way, Baby

Two years at Pentium speed

By Brant Houston
NICAR Managing Director

We're taking a moment here at the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting to hit the break key and review what we've accom­plished in the past two years with the help of our staff and volunteers, the funding from founda­tions and the support from the farsighted and adventurous throughout the news profession.

Begun in 1989 by the Missouri School of Journalism, the institute was revitalized in 1994 after the school and Investigative Reporters & Editors joined forces to promote computer-as­sisted reporting (CAR) through expanded train­ing and services.

When I arrived in February 1994, there were two graduate assistants at NICAR. Since then, our full-time and part-time staff has increased to a dozen. We have a training director, several graduate assistants, a World Wide Web site administrator and web designer, an assistant systems administrator, and an office coordina­tor. We also share support staff with IRE, of which NICAR is an administrative division, including a bookkeeper, office manager and seminar coordinator.

With this staff, we have conducted more than 125 seminars throughout the United States for more than 5,000 print and broadcast journalists during a two-year period. With funding from the Freedom Forum and Knight Foundation, we have initiated a minority training program.

Our database library has increased from a handful of offerings to more than 20 different databases that we have distributed to more than 90 news organizations. And we have done data work for organizations ranging from small news­papers to national TV magazines.

On the paper publishing side, this newsletter's circulation has more than quadrupled from 80 subscriptions to more than 400. We also have published a book on CAR stories, "100 Com­puter-Assisted Stories," that shows how such stories are done, and IRE and NICAR supported my work on a basic primer on CAR, "Computer-Assisted Reporting: A Practical Guide," which is published by St. Martin's Press.

While all this activity was going on, we have developed online offerings for the profession with the financial help of IRE supporter Greg Hillman and the Freedom Forum.

You can go to our web site at http://www.reporter.org and find your way not only to NICAR's and IRE's web pages (where you can obtain sample data and do research on investiga­tive reporting), but also to web pages for minor­ity journalists' organizations. You can also join

New books for online journalism

Just in time for NICAR's newest training push — computer-assisted reporting for broad­casters — come two books for using online resources for news stories.

The first book, "Wired Journalist" by long­time broadcast and print reporter Mike Wendland, is aimed at TV and radio journalists. Wendland is a full-time reporter at WDIV-TV in Detroit where he practices CAR on a daily basis. He also teaches at NICAR seminars and knows how to make computer technology easy to understand.

His book, published by the Radio and Tele­vision News Directors Foundation, is practical and to the point. He avoids "geek speak," using a relaxed and friendly tone to explain the Internet and how to use it for news stories. It's must read for broadcast journalists just starting to Net surf, and it's a handy reference book for those who have already begun.

Also out is Randy Reddick and Elliot King's revision of "The Online Journalist," which is now called "The Online Student." Reddick and King, two university professors, had the misfor­tune to publish "The Online Journalist" right before the World Wide Web exploded. Now they are back with a valuable excursion into online resources. More detailed than Wendland's book, this would be a good follow-up compan­ion. For professional journalists, the chapters targeting student concerns might seem unneces­sary, but this still is a good introductory text.

Meanwhile, don't forget Nora Paul's excel­lent web book, which you can find at poynter.org, or order the hard copy from the Poynter Institute in St. Petersburg, Fla.

Tech tips: It may look like a table - but it's not

Parsing is the answer

By Natalya Shulyakovskaya.
NICAR Staff

Parsing comes into play when you need to turn a text file into a table with rows: and columns. There are plenty of those text files scattered all over the Web with numbers and other information organized into columns, or, once in a while, you get a disk from a bureau-crat with data in report format: The files look like tables because the information is orga­nized into separate columns, but they are flat text files. They may have a .txt extension, the extension .dat or some other creative three-letter extension — or no extension at all.

You can open these files with a text editor, but no database manager or a spread sheet will recognize them as tables. At this moment, you know it's time to parse.

One word about downloading files using Netscape: If you are saving a table-looking file from the Web, make sure to save it as a text file and not as an html file. You don't want to waste time fishing out html coding from the document; let the browser do it for you. If you are not using Netscape, you may have to strip out the html coding using an html browswer or text editor before proceding.

Straight to the business

Lets download and parse one of the tables from the Census Bureau Web site (http://www.census.gov/)

The easiest tool to use for parsing is Excel, but remember: Excel can only handle up to 16,000 records in one table.

Table 1. Projections of the Population of Voting Age, for States, by Sex, Race, and Selected Ages: November 1996: http://www.census.gov/ftp/pub/population/socdemo/voting/proj/votepg1.asc

Go to the File pull-down menu, pick Save As and for File Type, specify All files. Save the file, and go to Excel.

In Excel, under the File pull-down menu, choose Open.

Find your file, making sure to specify the correct file type — it should be text only(??). Excel will bring you to the Text Import Wiz­ard.

On Step 1, you have an option of specifying Original Data Type. Here are your choices:

Delimited: All elements in the text are sepa­rated by special characters, such as quote marks, ampersands, tabs, spaces or commas.

Fixed Width: Fields are aligned in columns, with spaces between each column of text or numbers.

Choose Fixed Width (see Variation below).

If your file has a lot of text on the top that you don't need in your table, note a small Start Import at Row box. You can browse your file in a window below your text with the numbers of each line. For our Census Projection file, choose Row 8 to start importing. If your file has some junk at the bottom, we will kill it after the parsing by deleting rows. The Wizard adjusts the view in the window. Click on Next.

In Step 2, you will slice your file into the columns: Use the mouse and click once to insert a new line; double click to delete a line. In some cases, Excel will put black vertical lines subdi­viding the columns for you. Often, though, it doesn't guess right. Click and drag the lines within the window. If you see any repeating junk characters, such as vertical bars, you can separate them from the other data with the lines, or you can clean them out later using Excel's search and replace function under the Edit pull­down menu.

In Step 3, specify in what format to import the data. Excel usually sets all the data types to General and guesses the data types; however, it doesn't always guess right. We will import all the columns as text.

Now, save your table using Save As under the File pull-down menu. Under Save As Type, pick Microsoft Excel Workbook.

Variation

This file also is a good example of how you can use the Delimited option. Before, when you opened the file, you specified Fixed Width. To see how the Delimited option works, repeat the process with the following exceptions: During Step 1, examine your file - each column is separated by a series of vertical bars. Let's use them as delimiters. Check the Delimited button.

In Step 2 in the Delimiters part of the dialog window, check the Other box and typel (vertical bar) in the provided window.

In Step 3, Excel puts the separating lines in

the place of those pesky vertical bars. Let's let Excel do the data format. Never trust it com­pletely, though, especially with dates.

Now, let's give the columns their names — just type them into the cells above the appropri­ate columns of information. If you plan to use your file later in FoxPro, limit the names to eight characters and don't use spaces.

Clean-up

Let's get rid of periods in our first column: Highlight the column by clicking on the gray bar above the column, and use the Replace option from the Edit pull-down menu. Put a period into the Find box and leave the Replace With box empty. Click Replace and see the periods dissapear into the ether. Let's save this file as Excel Workbook, too.

What we just did with Excel is possible with Visual Foxpro 3.0. In FoxPro 2.6, in order to import a text file, you must build a correspond­ing table structure and then append a text file to the table as an SDF (standard data-file format), herding the data into correct chutes.

Visual Fox lets you do the parsing without going to Excel for help. Use Import under the File pull-down menu. Choose Import Wizard from the pop-up menu and follow the steps. Visual FoxPro will ask you to name the columns and set up the data format within the Wizard.

our listservs to discuss CAR and investigative reporting.

In the next few months, we hope to unveil new web pages that will provide even more help to journalists.

Most important, we have stuck to our goal of working with other groups to form alliances to do better work. In the past two year, we have offered seminars with Northwestern Univer­sity, New York University, the University of North Carolina, the University of Maryland and Indiana University. We worked, too, with many other societies including the Society for Profes­sional Journalists, the Society of Environmental Journalists, and the Unity Conference.

We hope to raise our work to new and higher levels in the coming months with your help and the continued financial support of the profes­sion and its foundations.

If you have suggestions for the future or observations about the present, please send them to brant@nicar.org

And thanks again from NICAR for a terrific two years.

Then I noticed the column marked "GXID," or Grade Crossing ID. That was the magic field. Within seconds, I had the correct answer.

If I've learned anything from this, it is DON'T GIVE UP. Whenever I got stumped, I'd take a break, get some air. If I was still stumped, I'd call NICAR or the FRA and ask for help.

I even believe this experience changed my life. As my wife will attest, I'm no longer afraid to ask for directions or admit I'm lost while driving my car. That's progress.

Outside a few well-paid directors, few mi­norities could be found in management-level jobs in any state agency. Blacks actually repre­sented a greater percentage of state employees than they did in the overall state population. But Hispanics, who now comprise at least 8 percent of Illinois' population, have yet to get state government jobs.

Bits, Bytes and Barks

Hate crimes
The Chicago Reporter, an investigative monthly, built its own database of hate crimes from police records obtained from the Chicago Police Department.

The paper chose 12 fields including type of crime, location, victim's age and race, offender's age and race.
The analysis found that hate crimes against whites had dropped, while those against blacks had risen, and there was a slight decrease in hate crimes overall.

Some information was missing, but even that turned into a story. The paper discovered the state of Illinois was violating state law by not collecting data on hate crimes.
— John Sullivan
