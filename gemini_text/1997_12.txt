IRE/NICAR Notes
Road map for the future

By Brant Houston
IRE/NICAR Executive Director
After nearly four years and more than
175 seminars and conferences, the staff
of IRE and NICAR have been assessing
what the next step should be in training
journalists in computer-assisted report-
ing.

We know that the demand for in-
struction in the basics - effective use of
the Internet, spreadsheets and database
managers
has not lessened.

But we also know that there are hun-
dreds of journalists looking for a higher
level of instruction and hundreds of
managers and editors trying to figure out
how to blend CAR into their newsrooms.

Past problems
When IRE and NICAR began its on
the road training at the beginning of
1994 we were confronted by a set of
problems that now seem to belong to
another century (and soon will):

• There was no real curriculum or
textbook for computer-assisted report-
ing.

• Managers expected reporters to learn
everything they needed to know about
CAR in one day.

• Reporters assumed they could learn
CAR, but avoid math.

• Many news organizations had no
personal computers for their newsrooms
and many reporters did not know how to
use a mouse.

• There was no point and click, visu-
ally pleasing World Wide Web.

• The word "database" was an unfa-
miliar term to most reporters and edi-
tors.

• The idea of training had only re-
cently come into fashion at most news
organizations.

As a result, some of our seminars
were, at best, a show-and-tell about the
electronic world that awaited journalists
once they had the equipment, software

Error Free
Goof-proofing
CAR

By Ronald Campbell
The Orange County Register
Confession is good for the soul.
Last May, I very nearly made the
most embarrassing error of my 21-
year career. The only thing that saved
me from printing the error was a
skeptical remark from one expert.
The only reason I made the mistake
in the first place was because I got
careless using a computer.

Computers have done wonderful
things for journalism.

At the same time, however, com-
puters have exposed a basic flaw in
journalists: We are, most of us, ter-
rible at math. We became reporters
because we couldn't cope with chem-
istry or economics or, God save us,

NICAR is a joint effort of
Investigative Reporters
and Editors and the
University of Missouri
School of Journalism.
NICAR services include
hands-on newsroom
training on computer-
assisted reporting, special
academic and advanced
training in data analysis.
NICAR is supported by
grants from The Freedom
Forum and other
foundations intended to
help the institute deliver
its services nationwide to
news organizations and
associations.

Looking to the future
and databases.

Other seminars created frustration because
reporters would get a jump-start on using
spreadsheets and database managers, but then
have to return to a newsroom where there was
no time or support for them to continue to
learn.

The more things change
While we still teach journalists who have
not used a mouse and/or searched the Web, we
find that most reporters, editors and news
directors are much more aware of the power
and potential of electronic information.

A journalist with superior computer-as-
sisted reporting skills is assured of a good-
paying job and the closest thing to job security
in our profession.

Nonetheless, we still hear about the hurdles
that journalists encounter in newsrooms when
trying to take their new skills and turn them
into stories.

The reporters are frustrated because they
sometimes work for managers who still think
one day on a keyboard and mouse should be
enough. There seldom is a plan for follow-up
training.

Access to equipment and the Internets are
not always guaranteed. In small to medium
organizations, the reporters work alone and
have no one to talk to about CAR problems.

The managers are frustrated because they
see reporters spending inordinate amounts of
time jockeying with software. The managers
don't see enough examples of using electronic
documents and databases to save time and
produce better stories. The managers seldom
get training for themselves.

At the same time, some colleagues are still
suspicious of the new-fangled ways. Some
CAR journalists don't help the situation by
slipping into geek speak, being supercilious
about newly acquired knowledge, or disap-
pearing into database inquiries that result in
"so what" stories.

Fixing the problems
However, none of these problems is insur-
mountable. Over the past few months, NICAR
trainers have been talking with other instruc-
tors and journalists who have completed
NICAR seminars. Slowly a consensus has
emerged. While the plan is not final, it is a start:

• First, we will continue the basic seminars for
those journalists just getting the opportunity to
learn CAR.

• Second, we'll concentrate much more on
relating CAR training to particular beats. We've
already done some of those kinds of seminars. In
the coming year, we will focus on areas such as
health care, crime, education, economy, business,
environment and city hall. We hope that these
seminars will show reporters and editors how to
get faster results from training, even if it's only
adding a key paragraph exposing an official's
spin, finding a source or getting a number or
salary that rounds out a story.

• Third, we'll offer special one-day sessions
for editors and newsroom managers who don't
have time to learn the details, but need to know
how to get a handle on using the new technology
for stories.

• Fourth, we'll work at improving the sophis-
tication of journalists when dealing with numbers
(see Sarah Cohen's article in this issue) so they
can avoid the pitfalls of using CAR or statistics
carelessly (see Ron Campbell's story).

• Fifth, we'll offer seminars on specialized
topics, particularly on mapping and visualizing
data and on how to write or broadcast stories that
aren't buried in numbers.

• And sixth, we won't forget the leaders and
pioneers in CAR in newsrooms who are trying to
develop ways to make databases and electronic
documents easier to use. In fact, in January we
will hold our first advanced seminar on those
skills.

A look at our program for our national confer-
ence this year, Indiana CAR, on our Web site
shows our efforts to move in this direction.

In the coming months, our Web site also will
carry more and more tutorials and tips on every-
thing from learning the basics to covering beats to
mastering advanced CAR.

As the year progresses, please let us know
what is working and what is not and we'll change
whatever we need to.

Erasing the errors
engineering. On our worst days we struggle to
remember how to calculate a percentage or a
percentage change; some of us don't know the
difference.

Yet computers invest us with the illusion that
we have mastered numbers. Senator Sleeze
collected $5,000,000 from 20 tobacco-industry
groups; the computer says so. The crime rate is
higher in North Palooka than in Detroit; the
computer says so. The city's five top banks
made no loans in the inner city; the computer
says so.

In fact, the computer has said none of those
things. We have said those things, and any of a
number of errors could have led us astray.

Error #1:
Nominating the wrong denominator. Every
percentage implicitly is a comparison of one
value with another. Pick the wrong denomina-
tor (the number by which the numerator is
divided), and chaos results.

Perhaps the most common example of this
error in CAR comes each year with the release
of FBI crime statistics. Crime rates are calcu-
lated by dividing the number of crimes in a city,
county or state by the number of people living
there; this number is then recast as a rate per
10,000 or 100,000 to allow easy comparison
among cities or counties. The problem comes
when you've got, say, 1990 population esti-
mates for one city and 1995 population esti-
mates for another.

I stumbled into a subtle version of the same
mistake. While analyzing Home Mortgage Dis-
closure Act data for California last spring, I
decided to calculate each major lender's market
share of the loans originated for whites, Hispan-
ics, Asians and blacks. After a few hours of
coaxing these numbers out of FoxPro I reached
a stunning conclusion: While the top 10 lenders
originated 30-40 percent of all mortgages to
whites, Hispanics and Asians, they originated
just 13 percent of all loans to blacks.

As a result, my analysis suggested, blacks
were unusually dependent on expensive "sub-
prime" lenders.

Let me pause for a moment and admit that
after four or five years of HMDA diving, I had
grown quite bored with my annual mortgage
story. Here, then, was a discovery worth savor-
ing: a national story buried in a familiar piece of
data. Every expert with whom I broached the
subject-academics, analysts, even bankers
expressed surprise and enormous interest.

And then I ran across an expert at the Mort-
gage Bankers Association, an economist who
spent even more time obsessing on HMDA data
than I did. He didn't believe my results. With a
certain amount of self-assurance, I offered to
redo the analysis while he waited. Within a
minute or so I had my numbers: My original
analysis was flat-out wrong; the top 10 lenders
had the same share of black mortgages as they
did of whites, Hispanics and Asians.

Later, I redid my calculations; as near as I
could tell, my original mistake occurred be-
cause I had divided the top 10 lenders' total
volume to black borrowers by the overall loan
volume to Asians - the group I had analyzed
just before doing the analysis of lending to
blacks.

Error #2:
What's less than nothing? The answer, of
course, is nothing. But with just a bit of work
you can calculate a percentage change showing
that a quantity has dropped 150 percent — a
remarkable feat, but one that routinely makes it
into the newspaper. The easiest way to do this is
to compare a negative and positive number, as
when a company reports a profit after a string of
losses.

While preparing this article, I posted a mes-
sage on the NICAR list, inviting anonymous
confessions. Here's one:
"Early in my use of spreadsheets, I did a
percentage change formula backwards for a 50-
state list. The scary part: It sailed right past two
copy editors, even though it said some states'
pollution had dropped by more than 100 per-
cent. Now I hand-check formulas on a calcula-
tor, and people in our group double-check each
other before we release calculations."

Error #3:
Comparing the incomparable. A murder is
not the same as a car theft or a robbery. So why
does anybody ever compare cities' crime rates
without at least breaking down the rates be-
tween violent and non-violent crime? And why

CAR Trips: First ventures
Beginner's lesson in teaching

Charles N. Davis
Southern Methodist University
When my new course, "Computer-Assisted
Reporting and Research," met for its final ses-
sion, my students were in full panic mode,
frantically scheduling interviews they should
have done two weeks before and double-check-
ing spreadsheets that should have been finished
a month earlier.

What happened? How did all those weeks go
by so fast? And why didn't my students do more
of the reporting work earlier in the semester?

Easy. I didn't require them to.

Staggered deadlines - having a rough draft
due one week, requiring that all primary source
interviews be done the next-would have saved
my students a lot of stress and made my grading
life a lot easier. It was one of several important
lessons learned by this first-time CAR instruc-
tor, who will be fine-tuning his syllabus in the
coming months.

Here are the major lessons I learned this
semester, in no particular order:

Sparking enthusiasm
Undergraduate students at most institutions
don't know what CARis-and don't share your
evangelical glee about doing CAR.

Upon my arrival at Southern Methodist Uni-
versity, I was approached by my departmental
chair, a forward-thinking type who saw the
obvious need for a computer-assisted reporting
course. I'd done a bit of CAR dabbling in my
previous life as a financial reporter, so I eagerly
volunteered. A grant sent me to NICAR's CAR
Boot Camp, where I saw the light.

I spent the summer honing lectures, develop-
ing spreadsheet and database exercises and lin-
ing up guest instructors from newspapers and
television stations. I even invited a private inves-
tigator who uses the Internet to track people and
assets for a visit. I was pumped. I was ready.

My students were not.

The first week, barely half of them showed
up. My speaker was uninspired, and I was mad.
But then it hit me: in my glee, I had neglected to
give my students context. I had scarcely defined
CAR, its importance to the reporter, its ability to
break great stories. I forgot to start at the begin-
ning, simple as it sounds.

So I made some changes on the fly.

I made the second week of class a sort of CAR
"show-and-tell." Using a CAR videotape of award-
winning IRE stories (a bargain at $20), I showed
examples of CAR stories. I passed newspaper sto-
ries out, and had the students identify the CAR
technique used and explain why the stories were
newsworthy. This led to a great discussion of story
ideas, and before I knew it, my students were fired
up and ready to go tell stories.

And, just to make sure the enthusiasm lingered,
I also came up with some type of homework or in-
class assignment for every week the rest of the
semester to keep them in the classroom.

Math lesson
Students don't know math.

I will now devote a lecture early in the semester
to mathematics. My students had to be reminded
how to average! I was stunned, until I thought about
my own liberal arts education, when I deftly avoided
all math courses.

Early bird data
Get your data at least six months in advance.

As a media law instructor who conducts re-
search on freedom of information issues, I knew
that the struggle for government information would
be time-consuming and frustrating. I often made
public records requests as a reporter, so I started
early in the summer seeking data for my exercises
and for student projects I had in mind.

Fortunately, I made one wise decision before
starting the data hunt: I came up with twice as many
data requests as I had students. That way, I could fail
half the time and still have plenty of data.

As predicted, it was a long, frustrating process
that left me at times wondering whether I was a
participant in a democratic government or a med-
dling outsider. But I got enough data for the semes-
ter, and it became critical to several course assign-
ments.

Student-led teaching
I have always been a vocal proponent of letting
students voice their opinions. My students in CAR
were all senior journalism majors. They were eager
enough to report, but didn't know what they wanted
to report on yet. So the first few assignments were
directed toward story origination. I wanted them to
find quality story ideas utilizing Internet research

Teaching CAR in class
and/or government data.

They found dozens of great ideas, many self-
generated. Some ideas were rejected, others were
traded among students, but in the end everyone
had a couple of great stories to chase.

Professional context
Lean heavily on the professional community.

When I began planning my inaugural CAR
course, I knew I had allies. I spent the summer as
a visiting professor at The Dallas Morning News,
where I learned some data analysis first-hand with
Shawn McIntosh. Shawn helped me with the
course plan, with my student's projects, and with
actually convincing me that I could pull it off. She
was my first guest lecturer, wowing my students
with a day-by-day account of how reporters used
the Internet, dial-up databases and other tech-
niques to chase the McVeigh story in the days
after the Oklahoma City bombing.

Sheryl Rubinett, WFAA-TV's news researcher,
came to class bearing dozens of great examples of
how CAR has transformed broadcast reporting.

Not every journalism professor has such a rich
media market to lean on, and some instructors
will have to look as far as a neighboring state to
find an expert. But don't hesitate to call upon the
professional community. In fact, the unwavering
support of the pros has been one of the most
rewarding parts of teaching the class.

NICAR, CAR-L, IRE and FACSNET all pro-
vide a great deal of support. I recommend them all
to aspiring CAR instructors as a source of expert
advice and good classroom exercises.

Don't be scared away
CAR is important. So important, in fact, that if
no course exists in your program, step right up and
volunteer. It appears daunting, but if you don't
teach it, who will? Am I a CAR expert? No. Not
even close. But neither are my students.

We're getting better at spreadsheets and data-
bases every day, with the students often teaching
me. It's been an incredible learning experience
for me, and it's rekindled my love for reporting.

Repairing errors
does any editor sit still for such journalistic
malpractice?

Error #4:
Missing the obvious. I hadn't intended to
write a screed about the FBI Uniform Crime
Report, but my data is leading in that direction.
Another anonymous confession:
"I was doing the FBI Uniform Crime Report
thing, ranking California cities by crime rate.
When I was all done, I started calling all the
usual suspects for reaction. One cop-manage-
ment guy said, "hmm," or something, then
"What's the top 10?" I read them. He said,
"hmm," again, then "Where's Oakland?"
"Well, the long and short of it is that, as you
probably can guess, Oakland didn't get its data
in on time and wasn't on the list, and of course
the FBI doesn't bother to point this out."

So what is a conscientious reporter to do? It
seems to me there are a few good answers:
First, if any finding takes your breath away,
then breathe in again, hold your breath for a
good 30 seconds, let it out and recalculate
your finding from scratch. Do it slowly. Look at
your own numbers the way you look at a particu-
larly squirrelly pol's conflict of interest form.

Second, widely share your findings before
publication.

Third, don't use statistical methods that you
can't explain while nursing a hangover. I am
very comfortable with percentages, percentage
changes, medians, means, modes and margins
of error. But I seriously doubt that I could
explain a chi-square or another sophisticated
measure of statistical significance under the
best of circumstances.

So I avoid using them in my research. I might
use them someday - after I've finally finished
reading those two big statistics books I've got in
my "to read" pile at home.

Lesson Plan
What teaching is really like

By Jeff South and Steve Doig
Virginia Commonwealth University and
Arizona State University
It sounds so tempting, to ditch the frenzied
pressures of the newsroom for the sedate, ivied
halls of academia.

Teach a few courses, spending perhaps 10
hours a week in classrooms filled with eager
journalists-to-be. Be part of a respected insti-
tution of scholars who prize your research and
technology skills. Take summers off, but en-
joy a year-round salary. And do all the
freelancing and consulting you can — it's
considered a credit to the university.

That glowing job description is legendary.
Its allure has encouraged some of the number-
crunching propeller-heads among us to con-
sider new careers as journalism professors,
teaching computer-assisted reporting. After
all, anyone in a newsroom who can calculate
percentage change reliably already has been
nicknamed "professor."

But before you surrender to this warm and
fuzzy vision of leisurely semi-retirement, take
a reality check. Teaching, at least teaching
well, is every bit as demanding and harrowing
as analyzing and mapping election-night pre-
cinct returns on deadline. University life can
be as frantic and challenging (and political) as
life in a newsroom. And colleges had more on-
the-job fatalities than newspapers did in 1995.

Oh, and about those "10 hours a week"? For
each hour in the classroom, plan on spending
four or five more preparing your lessons —
and praying you won't fall flat on your face
like a bad comic on open-mic night.

Not that we want to discourage you. As
longtime journalists who recently became pro-
fessors, we have no regrets about joining The
Academy. We see the rewards every day:
Students buzzing with energy and enthusiasm
—learning the skills needed to help the news
media survive and prosper in the 21st century.

But when we switched careers, we had few
clues beyond tweed jackets and a whiff of
chalk dust what a professor's life would be
like. We want to share lessons learned since
then, and for good reason: You, too, soon may
face similar career-change choices.

As more and more journalism schools real-
ize the importance of computer-assisted reporting,
they will be encouraging, even recruit-
ing, CAR-adept reporters. The authors of this
article illustrate the trend: We each spent two
decades in newsrooms, specialized in CAR, then
recently became full-time professors.

Here are some things we learned that you
should know if you, too, are considering making
the jump from newsroom to classroom:

1. Teaching is hard work.
You're often barely 24 hours ahead of your
students, madly grading their work from the last
class and trying to create meaningful lessons for
the next. Reporters-turned-professors typically
spend more time each week doing their new jobs
than they had spent doing their old ones.

Many of us learned writing in the newsroom,
where a better writer or a tough editor coached us
one-on-one. In a typical journalism class, you'll
have 20 students who need that kind of tough-
love coaching.

If you don't invest the time, students know
they're being cheated and they'll be rightfully
angry: They're losing far more than the cost of a
newspaper.

2. Being an expert is necessary — but not
sufficient — to make you a good teacher.
When standing before a roomful of students,
you have to be as much a performance artist as
fount of wisdom. You must learn how to engage
students, generate discussions, anticipate ques-
tions, set and enforce rules, explain, listen, ex-
plain again. Remember those boring lectures back
in college where the professor droned on and on?
Today's students don't like them either.

3. Though we both think that working with
students is our most important task, teaching
still is only one-third of a professor's functions.
We're also responsible for research/scholar-
ship, and for service. Research can be doing full-
fledged academic studies, developing new train-
ing materials, publishing an occasional article,
and so on. As for service, we are expected to work
with journalism professionals and organizations,
advise student groups and publications, and serve
on myriad committees. Often, you need to spend
about 50 percent of your time on each of those
three functions.

As a CAR expert, you are likely to be ap-
pointed to a slew of university advisory commit-

Continued from page six:
Learning to teach
tees: on curriculum development, technology,
faculty recruitment and other subjects. Many
weeks, you'll spend more time in committee
meetings than in the classroom.

As a faculty member, you also spend consid-
erable time advising students.

Sometimes it's on official matters like se-
lecting courses, graduating and getting a job. In
addition, you'll often be asked for advice on
unofficial topics ranging from immigration prob-
lems to apartment hunting to help with a prob-
lem in some other class. Walk-in visits from
students are fun but time-consuming.

4. Students and reporters have different
learning styles.
As the CAR wizard in your newsroom, you
were used to working with reporters focused on
learning a particular computer skill so they can
get their story in tomorrow's paper. But to
journalism students, you must teach a con-
tinuum of skills and show how they fit together
and could apply to any number of stories.

Reporters are quick to make the connection
between data crunching and the story. They
don't need much direction after you've run that
list of school bus drivers against the list of
drunken driving convictions. But students inex-
perienced in journalism may have trouble see-
ing where the story is headed. As a professor,
you'll spend a lot of time helping students
conceptualize stories, not just SQL queries.

5. Students defy the stereotypes.
They're not unmotivated slackers snoring
away in the back rows. They're not necessarily
computer whiz-kids, either.

These days, many students work part-time or
even full-time jobs. Some are single parents.
And they're taking three, four or five other
courses as well as yours.

Most aren't willing to learn by rote, simply
swallowing what they're told without chal-
lenge.

Classroom discussions on ethics, diversity,
civic journalism, invasion of privacy and other
topics often are as interesting and heated as any
we've heard in a newsroom.

Compared to a newsroom, a journalism class-
room generally is filled with a much wider
range of abilities and weaknesses.

You'll have some students who haven't
learned to conjugate verbs properly, and a few
who can write better stories and CGI scripts than
you can. It takes time and thought to tailor
lessons, assignments and grading strategies for
such a diverse mix.

6. Just as newspapers still struggle to main-
stream CAR into the reporting process, jour-
nalism schools are struggling with how to put
it into their curriculum.

There's no widely-accepted model of how
CAR should be taught:
Stand-alone courses, integrated into existing
courses, or some hybrid. As the new CAR
expert on a university faculty, you may be called
on to build a program from scratch.

Also, you may be surprised at the limits on
what you can teach. Academic freedom is very
real, but your dean will decide what courses you
will handle, based on the needs of the school.
You can't just barge in, whip together a course
in spreadsheet reporting, and require students to
take it. Because of accreditation requirements,
journalism students take only a fourth of their
credits in journalism.

By the time they have taken the mandatory
courses, they'll have room for very few elec-
tives. That's why you start looking seriously at
ways to work CAR concepts into other existing
courses.

7. While some parts of the university may
be on the cutting edge of technology, journal-
ism schools often are lagging.
They've been using computers, mostly Macs,
largely for newspaper design. As a professor,
you may be hard-pressed to find the CAR hard-
ware and software you used back in the news-
room. Moreover, school budgets often are tighter
even than those in the newsroom; getting that
faster CD-ROM, that software upgrade, even
that trip to NICAR's next data extravaganza,
may require some blood, sweat and tears.

Again, we hope this doesn't scare you off.
The work may be considerable, but the satisfac-
tions are immense. And you'll find it stimulat-
ing to learn and practice these new skills at mid-
career. If you bring from the newsroom the same
dedication to knowledge and pride in doing
good work that you practiced there, you'll make
a happy — and successful — professor.

RISKY BEHAVIOR WORKSHOP

"RISKY BEHAVIOR":
A Workshop on lifestyle
and health databases
•January 23-25, 1998.
IRE and NICAR are offering a special three-
day seminar on reporting on lifestyle and
health issues Jan. 23-25, in St. Louis. The
seminar is cosponsored by the Missouri School
of Journalism and the Division of Chronic Dis-
ease Prevention and Health Promotion of the
Missouri Department of Health (MDOH).

This exciting new kind of seminar will include
panels by health experts from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the
Missouri Department of Health and top jour-
nalists in the field.

Unlike other health-care seminars, this one
will focus on how to use databases that apply
to a wide range of beats — hard news,
features, business, health and science - and
monitor the day-to-day health habits of read-
ers and viewers. The seminar will also offer a
day and a half of training in computer-assisted
reporting (CAR).

The seminar is inexpensive with financial
assistance available to those journalists whose
news organizations cannot support them.
Please keep in mind that seating is limited for
CAR training.

The seminar will take place at the St. Louis
University campus. For more information,
please call IRE/NICAR at 573-882-2042.

HERE IS THE PROGRAM:

FRIDAY

8:30 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Registration: Coffee
and donuts.

9:00 a.m. Welcome.

9:15 a.m. Overview of public health: How
the CDC addresses chronic disease preven-
tion, control and surveillance. How the me-
dia can learn from public health officials and
how public health officials can learn from the
media. Speakers include top officials from
CDC and MDOH as well as top journalists.

10:15 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. Break.

10:30 a.m. Valuable data: what is in the
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS) and how journalists can obtain the
free CDC database. What other valuable pub-
lic health databases are available to journal-
ists. Speakers include NICAR trainers, as well
as officials from CDC and MDOH.

12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. Lunch.

1:30 p.m. Misunderstandings and misuse of
databases, health information, common mis-
takes, bad writing, exaggerated problems,

IRE/NICAR Notes
Broadening a CAR program

By Dave Gulliver
Dayton Daily News
Finding the military's problem doctors took
a year for a veteran reporter.
Finding problem roads and out-of-town
campaign contributors took some computer-
assisted reporting novices just a few days.

In October the Dayton Daily News pub-
lished a series on how the military can hire
unlicensed and unqualified doctors, and how
they are rarely held accountable for errors. The
series was picked up in papers coast-to-coast
and on TV's "20/20."

Reporter Russell Carollo, a computer-as-
sisted reporting veteran, spent more than a year
finding and acquiring military and state medi-
cal databases, then cleaning them and creating
more of his own.

The result was another chapter in the paper's
history of long, comprehensive CAR projects.
But until recently databases hadn't been a part
of regular news coverage, and only a handful
of reporters had the know-how.

In July the paper set a goal of getting more
computer-assisted work into smaller projects
and everyday reporting.

The first step was hiring me, to have a
newsroom CAR resource. That role entails
some heavy lifting, teaming up with reporters
on projects, and general cheerleading on com-
puter use.

The second step was bringing in a veteran
for some basic training.
My background is on PCs and this is a Mac
shop, so Griff Palmer of The Daily Oklahoman
came in for a three-day Boot Camp.

He ran four reporters through some basic
training, and then he and I worked on advanced
SQL for data cleaning and table-building.

Using CAR every day
With only an occasional pointer, schools
reporter Lynn Hulsey has been using Excel and
FoxPro in much of her everyday work. Last
week she used Excel to analyze the differences
between education plans proposed by the gov-
ernor, Senate and House.

In September, we imported state proficiency
test data. She analyzed it for a next-day story,
then did more analyses for a weekender.
Now, with several tables built, she uses it as
a resource in daily work.

Next step: Linking test performance data with
spending data.

City hall reporter Laura Bischoff wanted to
check tips about the police department's re-
sponse time to 911 calls. She negotiated for the
dispatches - 53,000-plus of them — and we
imported them from a nine-track tape.

That analysis only led to another question, one
that requires the record of all received calls.
We expect to receive those records in Decem-
ber.

But as we worked on that project, the interim
campaign finance reporting deadline arrived in
the mayoral race.

We had nine days to analyze the records before
the election.

In the past, the paper had not tried to do more
than a cursory analysis. This year, we went for a
broader story.

Laura, one of the more computer-savvy report-
ers, built her own database structure. With help
from clerks, we inputted the bulk of some 1,400
records. In four days we had turned a story in four
days showing how money from affluent suburbs
figured in the race.

Finding the trends
Trends reporter John Keilman and I wanted to
look at crime patterns in Dayton and some two
dozen nearby cities and towns. So we put FBI
UCR data and Census population figures into
Excel, and assembled per-capita and percentage
change tables for the region.

That sparked John's interest, so he sought out
traffic accident data on a rapidly growing adja-
cent county.

We downloaded the 25,000 records from a
state FTP site, then imported it into FoxPro.

With some careful sorting and traditional re-
porting he was able to pinpoint some trouble spots
and surpass the findings in a state report that came
out just as we finished the project.

Two investigative reporters, Jim Bebbington
and Steve Bennish, already had some database
experience.
But the three-day in-house boot camp has them
aggressively pursuing major state databases for
projects.

Business reporter Mike Drummond also so-

Medical Malpractice
Military hospitals report

By Brent Johnson
NICAR
The teenage daughter of an Army hospital
nurse in Colorado underwent a routine explor-
atory procedure to determine whether her se-
vere abdominal pain was due to appendicitis or
a tubular pregnancy, but emerged permanently
crippled in her right leg after a main artery was
punctured by a doctor not licensed to practice in
the state. That doctor, who had a history of
malpractice allegations and disciplinary actions
against him, was approved for transfer to the
hospital by its chief of gynecology, who himself
had a history of allegations and disciplinary
actions against him, because the department
was short-staffed.

In Washington, D.C., a Navy lieutenant who
had an abnormal grouping of veins and arteries
at the base of his brains now suffers from
memory problems, mood swings and sleep dis-
orders caused by an unsuccessful catheteriza-
tion attempt that tore an artery. The new prob-
lems have kept the lieutenant from achieving
the mandatory promotion needed to continue in
the service. The internationally known doctor at
a nearby university hospital where the lieuten-
ant was transferred was later unable to catheter-
ize the same artery that had healed but was by
then almost completely closed. The doctor did
make the following reflection: "There are two
kinds of doctors in the military. They're either
fabulous, wonderful doctors, or they're spec-
tacularly incompetent."

It is that spectacular incompetence that a
recent series in the Dayton Daily News detailed
painstakingly. The series, led by reporters
Russell Carollo and Jeff Nesmith and editor
John Erickson, was more than a year in the
making.

"Whenever you take on the military, you
have to have time on your hands," Erickson
said. "The military tries to drag out requests for
public records."

Malpractice loopholes
The reporters documented a secretive atmo-
sphere destined for trouble. Military doctors are
not required to have either malpractice insur-
ance or licenses from the states in which they
practice. By law, they cannot be sued. The
defendant in malpractice claims is the U.S.
government, not the doctor. Furthermore, claims
cannot be filed by active military personnel or
personnel stationed overseas. They conclude that
the military is "a magnet for problem doctors," a
fact only made worse by recent downsizing.

The team used more than a dozen databases to
lead them to the appropriate records and
interviewees that shaped the series on care pro-
vided by the 115 hospitals and medical centers
and 471 clinics that comprise the Military Health
Services System. Some databases were acquired
only after a federal judge ordered them released
by the military; some were built by the newspaper
itself based on information from state medical
boards; and some were updated and combined
from two prior series on the military.

The Dayton Daily News also went to court to
obtain the Department of Defense's TORT2 da-
tabase, which identifies individual doctors, their
qualifications and their links to medical malprac-
tice claims. The paper still has not acquired it.

Similar records identifying civilian doctors
with malpractice claims are required by states
and available to the public.

The National Practitioner Data Bank, too, is
used daily by hospitals, HMOs, insurance com-
panies and state medical boards for background
checks. But the newspaper found, for instance,
that from 1994 to 1995, though the Army paid
$66 million of taxpayer dollars in malpractice
claims, only one of its doctors was reported to the
Data Bank.

"The military employs about 18 of every 1,000
doctors in America, yet it accounts for just two of
every 1,000 malpractice reports in the database,"
Carollo and Nesmith wrote.

The reporters also discovered that the military's
own confidential database contains nine times
the number of malpractice cases it has reported to
the Data Bank.

Unable to force its release, Erickson said the
newspaper instead used the tort databases main-
tained by each branch of the military.

Those databases do not include the name of
the doctor involved as in the TORT2 database but
do include the name of the attorney filing the
claim and a synopsis of each case.

Sorting through the records for leads on the
most egregious examples, he said the team would,
for instance, isolate claims of brain damage and

Crime Counts
Taming crime statistics

By Jere Downs
Philadelphia Inquirer
This story began when the Inquirer screwed
up crime statistics reporting.

In July, the Inquirer followed the annual
release of the Pennsylvania State Police UCR
report with a front page story trumpeting that
overall crime fell 17 percent in Delaware
County, the Philadelphia area's most urban
county. But what the Inquirer missed was that
Delaware County looked so good because it's
second-most crime ridden town had been com-
pletely omitted from the state's crime report.

Upper Darby Township was left out of the
annual report, state officials told us, because
police there had simply failed to report on a
timely, monthly basis. The second-day, front
page story was a feature-length correction that
began something like "Delaware County resi-
dents, put down the champagne." Meanwhile,
back in our suburban headquarters, reporters
and editors broke out the annual crime reports
to better our understanding of crime statistics.

Getting a handle on the stats
In his spare time, an editor began inputting
two years of crime statistics into Excel to try to
get some perspective. That effort grew to a
five-year analysis of crime in 255 suburbs in
seven suburban counties surrounding Phila-
delphia.

All the data was entered by hand from
printed state reports into Excel. Most "Part
One" or serious crimes were included: murder,
manslaughter, rape, robbery, aggravated as-
sault, burglary, larceny and car theft. Our goals
were first to save face with a sound analysis of
suburban crime, and secondly to build a per-
manent five-year database that reporters could
use to write breaking news about crime in its
true historic context.

We learned early that crime statistics are
rife with error and tricky to interpret. Larceny
in one town may mean shoplifting at a major
mall. In another, larceny could mean a rash of
thefts from unlocked cars. As far as errors
went, many crimes appearing in the state's
report seemed patently wrong. For example,
one suburb showed 92 arsons in one year.
Impossible. The state police told us that must
have been a data entry error. In addition, about
half of our 255 towns had submitted only nine
months of reports, and the state police ended up
estimating missing months. We printed out all the
data and scanned for what seemed like anoma-
lies. Reluctantly, staff writer Larry King and I
concluded we would have to conduct phone inter-
views with local police departments to be sure we
got the numbers right. That took about three
weeks. In the end, we interviewed 100 police
chiefs to correct the data.

I ran into another snag when Jennifer LaFleur
was visiting the Inquirer from the San Jose Mer-
cury News. Looking at our data, LaFleur, who is
head of computer-assisted reporting in San Jose,
correctly pointed out that state police population
numbers did not seem to reflect suburban growth
over the five year period. When state police
numbers were compared to U.S. Census esti-
mates, it turned out LaFleur was right. The state
police population estimates were thrown out, and
I substituted U.S. Census estimates. Where none
were available for off certain years, like 1993 and
1995, I calculated the compound average growth
rate of each town's population for an estimate.

Getting the story
The intensive effort to correct the crime data
was worthwhile because we also learned about
trends in detail along the way. For example, when
it was time to do spot reporting to highlight
instances of crime, we were able to pinpoint
exactly the communities and chiefs we wanted to
focus on because of the prior interviewing and
data analysis. This cut down a lot on time spent
searching out anecdotal trends. Correspondent
interns helped out by spot-reporting in towns on
their beats.

The result was an 80-inch story which focused
on property crimes as the major offenses of
substance in the suburbs. We mapped the aver-
age, five-year property crimes of burglary, lar-
ceny and car theft throughout the region to show
which suburbs were hit hardest. Neill Borowski,
the Inquirer's director of computer-assisted re-
porting, mapped a five-year-average crime rate
throughout the suburbs for a large, inside re-
gional map. In addition to the front page story,
each of the seven county 'Neighbors' sections ran
that day with a unique crime story about trends in
that area. Inside each 'Neighbors' section, read-

ers were also provided with extensive graphics
listing car theft, burglary and larceny rates in
their towns and neighboring suburbs for the last
five years. All of the data was posted to Philly
Online, the Inquirer's web site.

I hope the story debunked widespread para-
noia about violent crime. We learned that old
established suburbs near Philadelphia's border
were often not the most vulnerable to theft
because of tight neighborhoods where neigh-
bors look out for each other, and crammed roads
that make poor escape routes for thieves.

The story also showed that new suburbs have
lost the exclusive, protected aspect they once
had, because malls and new highways lure
thieves to affluent areas.

However, suburban dwellers stubbornly cling
to the notion they don't have to lock up. Police
chiefs know otherwise, and said theft could be
cut way down if only homeowners would lock
their belongings.

Reader response was fantastic. In the week
after the story was published and the historical
data put on-line, a reporter in our Delaware
County bureau looked up one town's rape record
to report on a string of rapes in that town.

The long term usefulness of the data made
the project more rewarding than a one-day story.
I hope reporters continue to use the on-line
database in this way. I have also received many
queries requesting the data from local planning
boards and agencies such as the Greater Phila-
delphia Chamber of Commerce.

When the Pennsylvania State Police release
their 1997 annual crime report, the Inquirer will
be ready. Never again, hopefully, will state
police crime statistics be reported out of context
here.

The crime report seems to have changed how
editors approach data stories in the Philadelphia
suburban bureaus. A year ago, it was difficult to
interest suburban editors in data analysis sto-
ries. They were rightly anxious to fill the book
and get stories in by deadline. However, it
seems editors are finding that the projects can
work to their advantage.

Always eager to fill large Neighbors sec-
tions, zone editors have embraced the idea of
listing large charts of data specific to small
towns, so readers can compare communities.

When the Census recently released popula-
tion data showing shifts between 1990 and 1996,
I wrote a story about the decline in population in
Philadelphia and its older, affluent suburbs.
Curious to see if there was indeed an "inner
ring" of stagnant suburbs around the city, I
asked Neill Borowski to map the changes using
GIS software.

The next day, suburban editors were so
wowed by the color maps they commissioned a
population treatment in the crime model. That
is, big regional map and story accompanied by
zoned sections with specific charts and stories.

Using data this way has also created some of
the most substantial cooperation between our
six, far-flung suburban bureaus that has ever
existed at the Inquirer. For each data project,
editors and reporters in the Pennsylvania and
New Jersey suburbs meet and discuss the trends
and plot coverage strategies.

The result is it enables us to take a broad
regional look, and zero in on local angles using
the zoned sections — exactly the mandate of
suburban editors. I am pleased they view com-
puter-assisted reporting as a way to get there.

Stats on the road
Math for every reporter

By Sarah Cohen
NICAR
"We do not expect reporters to be math-
ematical geniuses. But we do expect them to
sidestep their mind-numbing fear of math-
ematics long enough to ask, 'Does this make
sense?' 'What would I conclude from these
numbers?"

A.K. Dewdney, in 200% of Nothing:
From Percentage Pumping to Irrational Ra-
tios, an Eye-Opening Tour through the Twists
and Turns of Math Abuse and Innumeracy

At a recent seminar, an editor recalled a tax
issue in which the funds raised would amount
to a two-thirds jump in spending on a project.
She dutifully reported every relevant number
her sources gave her, acknowledging much
later that she had no clue what any of them
meant.

She mentioned that numbers meant noth-
ing to her, other than a quite effective way to
mess up a perfectly good story.

It wasn't until years later that she knew
enough about numbers, about perspective,
and about selectively using statistics in sto-
ries, to make sense of the budget issue.

So when it comes time to write about the
math that every reporter should know, it's
also time to step back and attack the journalist's
fear of numbers.

This month, I'll give you a mercifully short
list of techniques you must know, and your
editors expect you to know.

Next month, I'll give you a couple of tricks
you can play on yourself to help overcome the
panic, or glazed eyes, that come when you
have to deal with numbers or statistics.

Fractions and percents
A percent is just a fraction, expressed as
100ths. You know one-quarter is 25 percent.
You may not remember why.

It's because 1 divided by 4 is 0.25. So think
of the words, "out of" when you have to figure
a percent of total.

Formula: (Portion/Total) x 100 = Percent
Example: If 250 people voted for Council-
man Jones, and 270 voted for Councilwoman
Smith, then the percentage of people voting
for smith is 270 out of (270+250), and the formula
is:
270/ (270+250) x 100, or 52 percent.

Percents
This is just the change over time, divided by
the starting level.
Remember, it's NOT the little number divided
by the big number. Changes can be greater than
100 percent.

Formula: (Difference / Old value) x 100 =
Percent difference, or ((New - Old) / Old) x 100

Example: A budget item rose from $1,500,000
to $1,600,000. Rounding off, the percent change
is:
(16-15)/15, or 1/15th, or 0.06667 x 100, or 6.7
percent.
Notice that you can reverse the process: 1/
0.06667 = 15, so the fraction is 1/15th.

Per capita, and other rates
You often need to level the playing field. It's
not fair to say that New York has more crime than
other areas, or that drivers of Fords die more
frequently than Hyundai owners.

You need to figure a fraction, and often raise it
to a bigger base than a percentage, to make a fair
comparison.

This is no different than percentages, only the
"out of" word gets changed while you change the
base to 1,000, 100,000 or something else.

There's nothing magic about 100 as a base. It's
convenient, and lots of people think that way. But
sometimes, that turns into too small of a number,
like in the number of infant deaths each year.

The hard part is figuring out the base. Often,
it's the corresponding population of a county, a
state or the nation.

For instance, crime rates are computed by
dividing the number of crimes by the number of
people living in the area, and multiplying by
100,000.

Other times, it's something else that levels the
playing field: Infant deaths divided by live births,
driver deaths divided by the number of cars on the
road.

Formula: (Number / Some base) x whatever
will give you a round number, usually 1,000 or
Continued on page seventeen

Continued from page sixteen:
Math for all
100,000.

Example:There were 80,000 crimes in Pitts-
burgh out of a population of 2.5 million. There
were 60,000 crimes in Tuscon out of a popula-
tion of 700,000. How can you compare the two
numbers?

Pittsburgh = 80,000/2,500,000 x 1,000 = 32
crimes per thousand residents
Tuscon = 60,000 / 700,000 x 1,000 = 85
crimes per thousand residents.

Different kinds of averages
You almost never hear anyone talk about
average incomes or average home values. There's
a reason they focus instead on the median value.
It's because medians ignore the effects of
very high and very low values.

Average: (Sum / Number of items)
Median: The middle item, in a sorted list
Mode: The most common value.
So in a list of home values [$60,000;$65,000;
$70,000;$80,000; $85,000;$130,000; $250,000;
$250,000] here are the three possible answers:

Average = $148,125, or $1,185,000/8
Median = $82,250 (average of the 2 middle
values)
Mode = $250,000
Most people would agree that the median is
the more "typical" value.
That's often how you can express it in a story,
too.

Adjusting for inflation
It may not be necessary for you to ever know
how to adjust for inflation, only that you know
you should adjust for inflation.

There are plenty of tools available on the
Internet for you to use.

Many newsrooms keep on hand and inflation
calculator.

But should you want to try it yourself, make
one decision first – what year's dollars do you
want to use?

I usually choose the most recent, since our
audiences understand what a dollar buys today.
To do this:

Formula: CPI New / CPI Old x Value Old

Example: Teachers made $28,000 in 1985.
How much would that be in today's dollars? The
Consumer Price Index was 107.6 then and stands
at 157.3 (for year-end 1996):
(157.3/107.6) x 28,000 = About $41,000.

Compound changes over time
Again, you may never have to do this, but you
should know about it.
If politicians promise that spending will rise
only 3 percent a year, after inflation, it doesn't
rise 3 x 10 or 30 percent over 10 years. It rises
much more.
It's the same principle that makes your own
nest egg grow.
To compound, convert the percentage back
to a multiplier.
For 3 percent, it's 1.03, or (3/100) + 1.
Then take it to the 10th power: 1.0310 =
about 1.35.
Now reverse the process, subtracting 1 and
multiplying by 100 to get about 35 percent.
Going backwards just reverses the process
and use 1 divided by the number of years as your
exponent.
To get an annual rate for a 35 percent jump in
spending over 10 years, use this formula: 1.35(1/
10) = about 1.03, or 3 percent a year.

A look ahead
A far bigger problem that I see on the road,
though, is the phobia many reporters have of
numbers.
Those who aren't afraid learn the formulas
above quite easily, if they don't already know
them.
Those who are can get all the cheat sheets in
the world, but they simply can't focus their
attention on the process.
So getting over the fear is the first step toward
actually understanding numbers, rather than
memorizing formulas. We will discuss ways to
overcome that fear by rounding off, developing
a sense of scale, watching television and asking
your best sources for help.
These tips will help reporters get over their
math phopia and will help readers better under-
stand their news and their world.

International Report
CAR down under

By Stephen Quinn
Deakin University (Australia)
One way to improve the caliber of newspa-
per reportage would be to teach reporters bet-
ter ways to obtain and analyze data. Com-
puter-assisted reporting is becoming recog-
nized as one way to do that in the United States.

What is happening in Australia? CAR has
not evolved in Australia to the extent it has in
America. In an article in Australian Studies in
Journalism in 1994, journalism lecturer Kerry
Green predicted that the Australian news me-
dia would eventually adopt CAR. The adop-
tion would occur "probably sooner than later,"
he said.

Three years later, he was still optimistic but
he accepted that CAR had not developed as
quickly as he expected. Costs, management
attitudes and time for training were the major
reasons for the delay, he said. "Someone in
control of the purse strings at a publication
must support CAR developments."

Given these difficulties, have working jour-
nalists in Australia ventured their CAR onto
the information highway? Key journalists at
Melbourne's two dailies (the Sun Herald and
The Age), the Brisbane Courier Mail, the
Sydney Morning Herald and The Australian
(based in Sydney) were interviewed.

Selection of newspapers was based on the
theory that news organisations can be divided
into "A" and "B" categories. "A" level organi-
zations are willing to devote resources to rе-
porting complex issues in the community,
nation and the world. In Australia, the most
likely candidates are the papers at the quality
end of the spectrum among the major capital
city dailies, and the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation.

Starting CAR
In June and July, I conducted a national
study of Australia's 49 dailies to discover
journalists' use of the Internet for
newsgathering. Two of the 27 questions cov-
ered the issue of deep CAR training, that is the
use of databases and spreadsheets for investi-
gative journalism. Only one paper, The Age in
Melbourne, said it had offered any CAR train-
ing.

An inquiry to the CARR-L mailing list in
August this year asking for the names of any
Australian journalists actively involved in using
CAR methods received no replies. An inquiry to
the same list last year produced one reply, from
Thom Cookes.

Cookes, a senior reporter at The Age, is one of
a handful of reporters in the country who employ
CAR methods. He has been producing stories
based on deep CAR since February last year.

CAR was "mostly virgin territory in Austra-
lia," he said. It could easily be sold to news
executives because it produced exclusives. "News
executives love exclusives because by their very
nature they are not on the news agenda, they come
out of the blue. It's a major selling point for
CAR.”

Cookes said journalists must learn how to
apply technology to the reporting process. "The
organizations and people that we are reporting on
are now more often than not keeping their records
electronically. Sometimes there is no paper docu-
ment to be FOI'd [obtained via Freedom of Infor-
mation legislation] or leaked. Government is scru-
tinizing itself — and is being scrutinized by
others - with the aid of computers and we should
be learning how to do the same."

Beginning training
The Herald Sun, also in Melbourne, has begun
some training of journalists, but at a basic level.
As of the end of last year, 12 journalists had
attended a one-day introduction to computers and
a further two-hour session on the Internet.

Keith Moor, editor of the paper's investigative
section, "Insight," said some of the paper's re-
porters were using basic CAR to arrange inter-
views via e-mail and conduct research via the
Internet. "CAR is another tool for journalists, like
the phone book."

The paper has one Internet connection but only
a handful of journalists know how to use it. Moor
maintains that journalism courses must introduce
students to the online world. "It's a vital tool that
journalism students need to know how to use."

Rodney Chester, computer and technology
writer for the Courier-Mail in Brisbane, said his
paper employs CAR methods. Since 1995, the
Courier-Mail had taken examination results from
schools around Brisbane, dropped them into Ex-
cel and analyzed them to produce stories. Chester

CAR down under
said his paper had not provided CAR training
but one staff member, who used spreadsheets
prior to joining the paper, had conducted infor-
mal sessions.

Jon Casimir, editor of the Sydney Morning
Herald's online edition, said journalists at the
Herald were beginning to use the Internet for
newsgathering. But no-one was doing any deep
CAR work.

"I would argue that there isn't a media outlet
in Australia committed to investigative journal-
ism. They've all been stripped back too much.
This is just my opinion, of course." No Herald
journalists had ever been sent to any of the CAR
training organizations in America, he said.

Malcolm Schmidtke, editor of The Austra-
lian until July this year, said his paper hoped to
send one or two people to such a course in the
next couple of years. Schmidtke said CAR would
be adopted in Australia---but much more slowly
than had been the case in the U.S.

"Sophisticated research-based journalism has
not been part of the culture in Australia in the
way it has in the United States. Editors have not
had the resources -- nor probably the inclina-
tion — to pursue long-term and complicated
projects that may in the end produce very little.
"Apart from a brief flirt with [UK] Sunday
Times style investigative journalism, Australian
papers have tended to rely on the dump of
documents or the whistleblower to provide the
impetus for investigation. However, times are
changing and editors - certainly this one - are
becoming more aware of the rich pickings in
databases."

A few television journalists use online jour-
nalism methods. Peter McEvoy, a former re-
searcher with the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation's flagship current affairs program
Four Corners, said he had used the Internet "a
bit" for research.

"It just seems sensible to have a look around
on the Internet to see what groups are active in
one particular story or issue. A lot of scientific
information, for example, is now posted on the
Internet."

A handful of enthusiasts on the nation's
major dailies are using CAR in their work. Some
newspaper owners are realising the opportuni-
ties that the Internet offers for newsgathering.

For example, all journalists at the Fairfax
organization (one of the three main newspaper
groups in Australia, and owners of the Sydney
Morning Herald, the Australian Financial Re-
view and The Age) will have e-mail and Internet
access from their desks by the end of the year.

I plan to conduct a similar study next year to
the inquiry I conducted this year. The results
could be fascinating.

loed on a project using FoxPro to figure CEO
salaries. Even some longtime reporters are see-
ing the trend and getting information off the
Web faster than they could get it otherwise.

As the year ends, that's at least a half-dozen
projects finished or nearly so, and they've re-
sulted in everyday reference tools for various
beats.

The Dayton Daily News is fortunate to have
good technical resources.

But the key to our progress was in people. We
brought in a pro to teach, creating some enthu-
siasm and showing a commitment to CAR.

We have a point man to help reporters past
sticky problems and point them to resources and
ideas, and who has learned enough to train more
reporters in the basics.

Most important, we gave people some time
to learn and practice. It didn't keep them from
working: No reporter took a whole day off.

But they got at least half-day blocks over a
few days, time for them to develop and practice
skills.

And as they begin to turn more routine stories
into full-fledged quick projects, more of their
colleagues are going to be looking to them for
pointers, or maybe looking for a training session
of their own.

Handout of the Month
CAR training tips

By Anne Saul
Gannett Co. Inc.
Many newspapers and televisions rely on
one byte head to do the operation's computer
work. For CAR to survive and flourish, how-
ever, the knowledge must be shared and taught
to others. The following handout offers some
tips of how to train staffers.

Before you start
1) Master CAR yourself. You can't train
others if you don't know how to do it. Make
sure you feel comfortable with the programs.

2) Produce one good story using what you
learned the first week. It needn't be a big
project; it just needs to be something that
proves the value of computer-assisted report-
ing.

3) Find a compatriot in the newsroom to
work with you - possibly someone who at-
tended a conference with you. Two people can
accomplish much more than one, and if one of
you is an editor he or she is in a better position
to convince your newspaper's top editor what
is needed in the way of resources and addi-
tional training.

4) Create a Buddy system. Initially, it might
just be the two or three or four of you. But once
you start getting converts, team them up with
someone who has more expertise.

5) Don't worry about trying to get everyone
in the newsroom involved. Many of them
never will. Other folks will want a piece of the
action when they see what you can do.

6) A word of warning — it will be slow
going for a while. Be patient, focus on your
own work and that of your buddy. Watch for
new converts, show them how it's done and
build from there.

Training others
First, look for resources in your building.
You can't do it all alone and you might find
help in places you never thought of.

In-house training:
1) The Human Resource Director. They
don't know CAR, but they do know training.
Talk to him or her about how to set up a
training program or class. He or she may even
be able to do a lot of the legwork for you.

2) Look for other in-house resources. They
may be where you least expect to find them:
a) One newspaper columnist who writes about
online services, teaches staffers how to access the
Internet, Compuserve, etc.
b) Someone from the marketing department
may know a lot about what data means since that
department has to make sense of marketing data.
c) Systems editors — if you have one — can
provide training in PCs and sometimes spread-
sheet and database programs. If you don't have a
systems editor, a systems technician can some-
times help - particularly with basic computer
training. Just make sure he or she speaks English
and not "technobabble."
d) The newsroom librarian. If you are fortu-
nate to have a good librarian, enlist his or her help
in finding data sources and in teaching a session
on what's available and how to get it.

3) Set up a regular training schedule. Focus on
those reporters and editors who have shown an
interest in what you are doing and make the
schedule realistic — say once every two weeks in
the beginning.

4) Keep it small. Forget the 2 1/2-day semi-
nars, in the beginning. Announce a brown-bag
lunch. Post the topic in the in-house newsletter or
on the front-end system. Don't worry if the turn-
out for the first few sessions is small. If you get
only one or two people, you have potential con-
verts and ambassadors.

5) Focus on story ideas - particularly those
from the reporters' beats - and talk about how a
spreadsheet or database program can enhance
those stories.

6) Start with the basics. Participants will have
a difficult time learning Paradox for Windows if
they've never used Windows or a mouse. Encour-
age them to play Solitaire to enhance their mouse
skills.

7) Divide up the expertise. Rather than forcing
trainees to learn several different programs, have
one person become the database expert, another
the spreadsheet expert, and so on. When a story or
project needs to be done, the experts can team up
to take advantage of their expertise.

8) Dump a city budget or other data from one
of those beats into a PC and show the other
staffers what can be done with the information.
(Avoid using the examples that come with the
program's tutorials; they aren't relevant to report-

ing.)

9) Remember to start with the story idea, not
the computer. (Yes, I said that before, but it
bears repeating.) Reporters and editors have to
see the relevance of what you're doing. Bud-
gets, by the way, are an excellent way to start.
Almost every beat reporter has to deal with them
at one time or another.

10) Assign "homework" to make sure par-
ticipants use the skills they have learned. Give
the participants a list of questions that can be
answered only if they use the program. (What
was the percentage increase in the police
department's budget over the previous year, for
example, if you used a city budget in the spread-
sheet class.) Let them use any resource they like
(manuals, etc.) to figure out the answer —
except asking a fellow staffer for the answer.

Regional training
1) Solicit participation from neighboring
(non-competitive) newspapers and pool the ex-
penses to bring in a trainer for a group session.
You may be able to get an expert from another
newspaper simply by paying his or her ex-
penses. CAR reporters and editors are always
willing to share their expertise and spread the
gospel.

2) APME and state AP bureaus conduct
regional CAR training utilizing AP and NICAR
trainers. These have been held in several cities
in the past year. The per-person cost is minimal
(often less than $50). Contact your state AP
bureau to inquire about a session in your area. It
helps if you've already solicited interest from
other newspapers in your state or region.

Local colleges
Check out local colleges and universities for
computer training - classes in Lotus or Para-
dox or computer basics if they don't offer any-
thing specially in computer-assisted reporting.
You might even find someone with CAR expe-
rience. The Free Press in Burlington, Vt., for
example, found a former reporter-turned-stu-
dent instructor who used to be president of IRE.

(A word of caution: Be careful of training by
non-journalists — such as at local business
schools or training institutes.

The trainer may know Lotus, but tracking
widget profits is hardly applicable to newspa-
pers. If you do use an outside source, see if you
can talk to the instructor before hand about what
you do, bring a sample — such as the city
budget.)

Training tools
1) Don't worry if your only available PC is a
386 with not much memory and an old version
of Lotus. It can handle the small projects you'll
want to start with. And once you produce some
stories, it will be easier to convince your editor
that a faster machine and more up-to-date soft-
ware are warranted.

2) By all means steal and copy everything
you received - except the licensed software, of
course.
Don't duplicate everything in the beginning
though; it will be too overwhelming. It's better
to copy only the handouts that are pertinent to
your particular training session.

3) Manuals/Cheat sheets: Put the handouts,
cheat sheets and other documents in a loose-leaf
binder for participants. That way, they'll have
the beginning of a CAR manual to which they
can add later.
Include lists of information/databases avail-
able local and at the state and federal level, how
to access DMV on-line, etc.
If possible, keep the handout files in a com-
puter so that you can update them easily. (Long
lists kept in the CAR computer also make search-
ing for data easier.) Encourage users to add to
the lists as they discover new sources of infor-
mation.

4) Form a public records committee and have
the members find out what local and state public
records are available in computer-format. Keep
others informed as to what's available; start a
database of databases. (The librarian should be
on the committee.)

5) Create a data center --- even it it's a single
PC and a bookshelf in a corner of the newsroom.
Keep manuals and public record information.
Create a catalog listing what's in the center.
Don't segregate it in a locked room that doesn't
invite people to use it.

National Conference. To get a copy of the

Workshops
IRE and NICAR can also bring road-tested
workshops to sites around the country. We
match regional public records experts and ex-
perienced reporters with our own trainers for
unique seminars ranging from one-day dem-
onstrations and panels on regional public
records laws to three-day hands-on sessions on
computer-assisted reporting or advanced tech-
niques for data-intensive beats.

Don't wait for someone else to organize a
computer-assisted reporting workshop in your
area. IRE and NICAR depend on members,
news organizations, journalism schools and other
journalism organizations to help us bring our
seminars to you.

NICAR is forging ahead with new seminars and new
approaches to conferences and workshops. The annual
conference, March 5-8 in Indianapolis, will not only in-
clude the usual panels and hands-on classes for beginners
to the advanced, but also a set of special half-day sessions
that will take in depth looks at how to use electronic
information for particular beats.
We also are expanding our seminars for the intermedi-
ate range. Earlier this year we did a seminar on education
and statistics. In the coming months, we plan to hold
seminars on database design and data cleaning, use of SQL
servers for the newsroom, mapping software, and business
reporting. Watch our Web site at www.nicar.org for dates
