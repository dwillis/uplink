FOI
Uplink update
This issue of Uplink details journalists' ongoing battles to access information. The new Electronic FOIA Amendments say the government should provide electronic data - but the law is not without its critics. Bob Anderson of the Freedom of Information Center tells the story.

Meanwhile, Jennifer LaFleur of the San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News talks about access problems journalists face in California and other states, and tells us how to get involved in the fight. NICAR's John Sullivan and Jo Craven detail recent electronic battles and the flimsy excuses bureaucrats offer in data dodges.

In other news, IRE Executive Director Rosemary Armao resigns to become Anne Arundel County bureau chief for the Baltimore Sun. And NICAR Training Director Neil Reisner leaves for the Miami Herald. The jobs are open — see stories on page 11.

Keeping up with the digital revolution
Ready, aim, FOIA
By Bob Anderson
Freedom of Information Center
The Freedom of Information Center has donned electronic flak jackets and entered the digital revolution. After responding to questions about accessing government secrets for almost 40 years, the center is now firing back answers to a bundle of queries its founders never could have imagined.

Some examples:
• Which states have the best open records laws for access to electronic information? Answer: One of the best is North Carolina with passage of recent amendments.
• Is Federal government e-mail considered a public document? Answer: Sometimes yes, sometimes no, depending on whether the information is covered by one of the nine exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act.
• How much can a state charge for copies of an electronic database? Can a state charge for redacting electronic information? Answer: Depends on the state. In Kansas in 1995, the State Court of Appeals ruled that the Department of Revenue could force newspapers to pay, at a minimum, hundreds of thousands of dollars for access to the state driver's license database. But the same year, Kentucky's state attorney general said that a $240 fee to redact juvenile delinquents' names from a database was unallowable.

As anyone can see, some information about electronic access — particularly on the state level—is as difficult to find as data on a fragmented hard drive.

But some other answers about electronic access are getting easier to find, particularly with the passage this fall of the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments law. Those amendments ease getting electronic information from the federal government (See related story on this page).

Throughout these shifts, the role of the FOI Center, located at the Missouri

Electronic FOIA
Amendments
get mixed review
By Bob Anderson
Freedom of Information Center
The Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996 are bringing the FOIA into the digital age.

The amendments were signed into law by President Clinton on Oct. 2. One of the key points of the amendments is that government should "provide for public access to information in an electronic format," such as databases stored on computer tapes and CD-ROM disks.

That issue— whether electronic information is accessible — has been acknowledged by several federal agencies for years. The new law "makes explicit" that such records are open to the public.

Digital revolution
School of Journalism, remains the same: It is a research and reference library focusing on controls placed by government and society on the free flow of information. The center's staff surveys articles from almost 150 publications and journals to add to its files collection.

Those files now contain more than 1 million articles and documents on the controls of information. That is why the center regularly gets requests from such news organizations as the Kansas City Star, the Arizona Republic, and the Associated Press. The center receives about 3,000 requests annually from students, attorneys, business people and journalists.

Some of the most recent additions to our collection add to the understanding of how government controls electronic access. They include BNA's Electronic Information Policy & Law Report, which surveys court and government developments on electronic information.

The center also subscribes to "Government Technology," a publication geared toward government managers who set up information systems.

The FOI Center has put its own digital footprint on the Internet with its Web site at: http:// www.missouri.edu/~foiwww. The site has the text of federal and some state public information laws, as well as links to a variety of sources about access to information.

Mixed review
The law also:
• Allows a requester to get information in "any form or format" requested, including computer format.
• Requires agencies to put a substantial amount of information on-line. That requirement applies to documents created after Nov. 1 and include "agency opinions and policy statements," information released under FOIA and likely to be requested again, and other information that the agencies now are required to release. Agencies have until Nov. 1, 1997 to make these records available on-line.
• Requires creation by agencies of electronic on-line indices of the records previously released under FOIA. The indices must be on-line by Dec. 31, 1999.
• Requires agencies to create a "multitrack" system for the release of records. In essence, simpler requests would be put on a different "track" than more detailed requests. Persons asking detailed requests would be given the option of limiting their request to get onto a faster track.
• Changes the time agencies have to respond to FOIA requests from 10 days to 20 days.

How worthwhile the changes will be is being debated. The National Security Archives, a private nongovernmental research library, states that some of the changes are flawed — including the multitrack provision, which, the Archives says, is "permissive" and old-hat, because many agencies already have a multitrack provision.

For a look at the Archives' analysis of the EFOIA amendments, check its homepage at "http:/ www.seas.gwu.edu/nsarchive."

A more harsh view of the amendments is offered by Bob Gellman, a Washington, D.C., privacy and information consultant. He calls the provisions "mediocre and limited." For his viewpoints, see the Oct. 9 issue of Access Reports.

Despite its shortcomings, the EFOIA does at least codify access to databases, the mainstay of reporters who specialize in computer-assisted reporting, said Paul McMasters, the First Amendment ombudsmen for the Freedom Forum and a nationally known expert on FOIA issues.

"Journalists should be especially happy about this," said McMasters, who recently was inducted into the National Freedom of Information Act Hall of Fame.

Media, agencies wrangle over fees, access
Electronic battles
By John Sullivan
NICAR staff
And your total is $300,000 — will that be cash or charge? That's what the AP's Special Assignment team heard when it requested the Immigration and Naturalization Services database on non-immigrant status, a system that tracks foreigners who enter the country for business or pleasure.

"This is a completely bogus denial," says Drew Sullivan, national news data editor for the AP. "I have been fighting this for two years, first at NICAR and now here."

Sullivan's experience mirrors that of many reporters seeking to obtain electronic records, says Rebecca Daugherty, director of the Freedom of Information Act Service Center at The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press in Arlington, Va.

"A large number of (our) calls deal with fee provisions for electronic data," Daugherty says.

The AP's case is doubly complicated. In its wranglings with the INS, a privacy issue arose. The AP agreed to the redaction of the questionable field from the database; however, the INS said the redaction constituted the creation of a new database - which is not required under federal law.

"We have seen agencies give the line that they don't have to create a record. In some cases, it involves only pushing a couple of buttons, but this is not a reasonable explanation," Daugherty says. She also says the EFOIA seems clear: Redacting a field does not equate to the creation of a new record.

Battle for state records
The EFOIA, effective in the coming year, will help reporters get public records, Daugherty says. However, federal bills such as the Boxer Bill may limit access to Department of Motor Vehicle records, requiring states to allow residents to "opt-out" of having their driving records open to public scrutiny. This will exacerbate what is already the most difficult battle for reporters: accessing state records.

Leslie Reis, an attorney for the Reporters Committee, says there is little precedent or case law in many states, and records access laws vary widely when you cross a state line.

Residency rule
That's what Geoff Davidian found when he sought to start a small investigative newspaper in Tennessee. Davidian tried to get some records through the state and was denied. The attorney general said that Tennessee law provides access to public records for state residents only. Since Davidian had just moved to Tennessee and was not yet a declared resident, he couldn't access the information. He got the information through his son who is a resident, but not without a fight.

Davidian has filed a federal suit claiming that the state is violating his right to privileges and immunities granted by the Constitution.

Reis says there is not much a reporter can do in such a situation.

"Many papers have argued that since they represent a considerable public interest in the state, they should be allowed to get information, but this approach hasn't been particularly successful,” Reis says. "We have seen an increasing number of cases where residency is being used to deny access to records."

Some cases are not a question of fees or residency. When a male nurse was fingered in the suspicious death of 165 patients at Vermillion County Hospital, the Indianapolis Tribune-Star began to request death certificates from the state. They discovered that many records were kept at the county level and were open. They also found that some counties opt to forward death certificates to the state. But at the state level, the same records are no longer considered open, says Tribune-Star City Editor Jim Lewers. The Star-Tribune sued.

Thousands of dollars later, the state settled out of court and the paper got the records.

Lewers says it is important to pursue these matters legally. "These are complex suits that are breaking new ground in the state and establishing some precedent," he says.

The Reporters Committee agrees and offers some recourse for reporters.

"We will give advice on cases where reporters have made requests for public records and have been denied, says Daugherty.

NICAR Staff
NICAR has been updating its list of the best (or worst, depending on your perspective) excuses that government agencies have given for refusing to fill data requests. Here are the war stories that reporters around the country have shared with us:

• Ande Engleman, former executive director of the Nevada Press Association:
"My favorite came from a county clerk in reference to a law requiring public access to 'all claims paid by the county' (meaning all checks written to whom and what for): "That's not an important law to follow,' the clerk said.
"My query of, 'Who says which laws are important and which ones are not?" was answered by a copy of a directive from the Nevada Department of Taxation, which said they would not be audited for following that law. We uncovered a real mess, which we took to the governor. The directive got changed very quickly, and all of a sudden this information became available in all counties."

• Bryant Jordan, Air Force Times:
"My editor recently asked the Air Force for some statistics relating to promotions. The official he asked responded by saying something to the effect that, 'Oh, those are irrelevant. You don't need those.'
"My editor's response went something like, 'With all due respect, I decide what's relevant."

• Drew Sullivan, The Associated Press:
"Here's one I got at NICAR: 'We can't give you the record layout because then you can hack into our system and change the data.""

• Michelle Moon, WAVE-TV:
"How about this excuse I got: 'Well, let me talk to your data guy.' My response: 'I am my data guy."

• Bill Kelly, Nebraska ETV Network:
"I don't think that's even in the computer."
"On records of purchases of tax delinquencies from a county treasurer: 'We only sell those to private businesses.' A protest to county board members eventually 'clarified' this policy, and the records were released, free of charge."
"In the midst of assisting in the instruction of an advanced reporting class with CAR skills training at the University of Nebraska, nearly everyone in the class was met with the following from a variety of agencies:
'We couldn't do that for a student."

• Paul D'Ambrosio, Asbury Park Press:
"New Jersey has no FOIA law, so we take routine denials in stride (can you say, masocists?) However, a few do rise to the 'you got to be kidding' level:"

ME, to a N.J. state department: I would like to have your line item budget for the last five years, either on disk or on paper.
THEM: I'm not sure we have that.
ME: How do you run your department if you don't know how much money you have?
THEM: Well, we have a budget, but we don't keep it in the format you want.
ME: I'll take whatever you have.
THEM: It'll take an employee two full weeks to do because we have to compile the information from several computers.
ME: I'll wait,
(Two weeks later)
THEM: It may take longer. This is a busy year for us. We're putting next year's budget together.
ME: Muffled screams

• Mike Ravnitzky:
"It's still a classified national security record, but we can't locate it."
"We can't release it because the agency responsible for that document is no longer in existence, and no other agency has taken over its responsibilities."
"Now, why would you want a copy of that, huh?"
"That was illegal, and we can't release information on illegal activities.

• Matthew David Waite, The Daily Nebraskan:
"I spent a half an hour listening to a university bureaucrat tell me that they did not have the power to pull salary data information off their mainframe system, yet they publish a book of salary data every year that is printed straight off a database.
"My response: 'Give me a half an hour of mainframe time, and I'll show you how to do it.'"

Groups work to open government records
Breaking barriers
By Rosemary Armao
IRE executive director
In September, the American Society of Newspaper Editors marked the 30th anniversary of passage of the federal FOIA by bringing to the Freedom Forum in Washington representatives from the nation's major journalism organizations, including IRE. It wasn't a celebration.

The point of the two-day session was that a whole lot more of us need to be doing more to see that anti-secrecy laws get used effectively and are expanded.

Seven groups brainstormed solutions for the biggest barriers now keeping the FOIA from fully opening up government to public scrutiny. They have agreed to continue working as an informal consortium to make those solutions happen.

Here are highlights of the two days' work:
• Improving FOIA
The problem: FOIA requests can take years because of staffing shortages in some federal agencies, bureaucratic resistance, prohibitive fees and the government's eagerness to exempt large amounts of information.
Some solutions: The recent passage of the Electronic FOIA is the first step toward strengthening the act. Penalties for the lack of compliance and hiding and withholding records would help. Journalists also should support laws that would make government records held by private firms subject to all FOIA rules.

• Expanding access
The problem: FOIA does not apply to Congress, the federal judiciary branch or to certain offices connected with the presidency, including the Council of Economic Advisers and the National Security Council. Moreover, Congress seems willing to consider changes to the FOIA only about once a decade.
Some solutions: Journalists should forget about expanding FOIA to Congress. Access to the administrative offices of the judiciary and to the presidential agencies would be more fruitful. Journalists need to reactivate old networks in which they watched over the disparate pieces of legislation that together make up federal information policy. The Presidential Records Act, for example should be reviewed with an eye toward pressing for more openness. Journalists should take advantage of Vice President Al Gore's interest in information exchange over the Internet.

• Using FOIA more
The problem: It takes too long for FOLA requests to be processed. Journalists don't know. how to file requests. Publishers and journalism educators are uninterested in supporting or promoting FOIA..
Some solutions: FOIA response time can be improved by promoting dialogue with public affairs officers before requests are filed, by working with public interest groups on requests and by urging more funding for FOIA offices. We should increase newsroom training on the FOIA and enlist publishers, editors and legal departments in a battle for better use of a law important to democracy.

• Supporting access.
The problem: The public sees the media as arrogant about their right to see all records, and there is a public indifference to FOI issues.
Some solutions: Emphasize the value to citizens of freely available information. We need to work with citizens groups and teach the public how to use FOIA and other records laws. We could list cyberspace sources of information and show the public its stakes in openness.

• Balancing security concerns
The problem: National security exemptions to the FOIA are overused, and there is still far too much classification of records.
:
Some solutions: Reporters need to educate themselves about FOIA issues and recent presidential decisions on secrecy and classification then demand compliance.

• Technology
The problem: Agencies resist compliance to requests for electronic records.
Some solutions: Journalists need to be vigilant that government data enters the public domain. Contractors should not be permitted to obtain copyrights or other property rights in public information. Agencies should be prevented from charging high prices for data and encouraged to redefine their mission to include dissemination of information to the public.

San Jose Mercury News
We may never know what the most common name for a dog is in San Jose, Calif., or who really sponsors roads in the California adopt-a-highway program. These examples may not be critical data for California news organizations, but when government agencies limit access to pet licenses and highway cleanup programs, imagine how they react to requests for personnel files and police data.

That's because getting databases about individuals is just one of the many access problems faced by California journalists. Another problem is that each agency chooses the format in which it provides records and a murky law allows for inconsistencies.

"California, being the largest state, might seem a goldmine for electronic information," said Chris Schmitt, Mercury News telecom editor and longtime CAR geek. "But the truth is, it's a jumbled, chaotic mess, with no clear guidelines, and decisions about releasing information seemingly based as much on whim as intelligent policy."

"Those things are really the problem areas," said Terry Francke, executive director of the California First Amendment Coalition, a Sacramento-based organization developed to advance freedom of information. "[One problem is the] overall anxiety about privacy concerns in general, including addresses in particular. The state legislature has just passed a bill that creates a joint committee that deals with computer and personal information and privacy, which will spend all of 1997 looking into both public and private uses of personal information in automated systems and probably will be making some legislative recommendations in the spring of 1998."

'No middle ground'
"It seems to me that with public records requests in the Golden State — paper and electronic—things either turn out very good, or they turn out very bad. There is no middle ground," said Rebecca Raney of The San Bernardino County Sun. "I've found that the agencies most willing to abide by the law are those with the most savvy attorneys. There's nothing uniform about application of public records laws here. It's a big free-for-all, with each agency responding as it sees fit."

Within certain types of records are little-known inconsistencies. "We had an experience with marriage licenses, which are public — right?" said Russell Clemings of the Fresno Bee. "But there were some records that were confidential marriage licenses. If you get married in the jail, it's automatically a confidential marriage license."

When it comes to getting access to electronic information, some of the barriers are greater because California's Open Records Act is not specific about access to electronic records; therefore, many agencies will only provide paper documents.

IRE Access Committee
Join the fight
By Jennifer LaFleur
San Jose Mercury News
Twenty years ago, a group of reporters came together to share resources on important investigations, and IRE was formed. Today, groups of reporters are joining to maintain and open access to public records.

Some of those examples include a group of Arizona reporters fighting potential changes in their state's Open Records Act; reporters in New York who put in a joint request for speeding tickets in order to review the impact of the 65 mph speed limit enacted last year — they were refused access to the database; and in several states, reporters are fighting for DMV records.

Nearly every day, the IRE and NICAR listservs see postings about more problems with access to records.

In response to those access issues, IRE recently formed a committee dedicated to helping reporters fight these battles. If we are to continue working toward in-depth reporting, we must continue to have access to the documentation necessary for such reporting. The Access Committee has set the following objectives so far:

... of better access
Francisco school district for electronic data. "The law is somewhat ambiguous as far as electronic records ... whether reports or the .dbf files were the published material," he said. "We ended up with hard copy only after many weeks of wrestling."

Murky law
"Meanwhile, the public records act itself is in the same stage it was in the '70s in a different universe in what is practical in the realm of computers," Francke said. "It's up to each agency as to what form or format or medium they need to give you."

The fuzziness regarding electronic records in the Open Records Act results in inconsistencies statewide — certain data is easy to get in one county but not in another. Clemings successfully gained access to police call data in his area while other reporters across the state have been denied similar data. While several cities provide their pet license database to journalists, the city of San Jose refuses, arguing that abusive spouses will seek out their mates-in-hiding or that others may use the data to locate police officers.

"There's also the issue about segregation of disclosable from nondisclosable information and whether an agency has the obligation to do that, especially if doing that requires a new program," said Judy Alexander of GenesisLaw, a San Jose media law firm. "It's that kind of manipulation and whether it's the creation of a new record that is really murky under California law."

In addition, agencies are all over the board when it comes to fees charged for data. Journalists can help each other by not paying high prices for data because it ends up setting a precedent and hurting others.

"It's also pretty clear if you listen to the lobbyists for state and local government," said Francke. "One thing they want to get out of all this is money."

But the picture of access in California is not completely grim, and experts are hopeful that revisions in FOIA at the federal level may spur states to include electronic information in their laws. In addition, we do have access to some databases not available in all states:
• Voter Registration data: This database is not a public record, but the press has access through a special exemption. This puts a lot of pressure on news organizations to limit use of such data to just the editorial side of the business. This data is available from counties and the Secretary of State. In some cases, the data is less costly from the Secretary of State's Office.
• Late contributions. The California Voter Foundation provided electronic access to large late contributions in the state through a listserv. This was an invaluable resource for reporters looking into campaign finance in the last days before the election.

In addition, more agencies are making data available on the Internet. Here are some:
• A complete list of California agencies on-line is available at: http://www.ganymede.org/ agencies.html

Tech Tip
Using Report Writer
By Tim Henderson
Gannett Suburban Newspapers
If you're like me, and I know I am, you were horrified the first time you realized there's no "print query" button in FoxPro.

Since then, you've probably copied your queries to a spreadsheet, then to a word processor, or found some other way to get your results on paper. If you found your way into FoxPro's Report Writer, there was no way to guess how it worked, and you gave up.

Truth is, once you learn a little about Report Writer, you may forgive its daunting first impression.

Not only can you print the same query you see in the browse window, you can improve on it by adding titles, changing your column headers to English, setting off groups with summary information, even calculating new fields and using functions to determine what's printed under what circumstances.

As an introduction to Report Writer, let's make a report on night home burglaries in the Phoenix area using the retas.dbf file in the NICAR ftp site (ftp://nicar.org/pub/data/ retas.dbf). Run this query to get the population and the number of night, day, and total home burglaries for the year:

SELECT agency, pop,;
burgrnt + burgrd + burgru;
AS homeburg,;
burgrnt AS night,;
burgrd AS day;
FROM Retas;
WHERE msa = "662"

To make this query work in a full Return A Supplement file, you'd have to sum the fields and group by agency because it would be broken down by month. This sample data includes only one month.

Now, choose Run... Wizards...Report, and pick Report Wizard from the Wizards menu.

(Experiment with the other Report Wizards also when you have appropriate data: multi-column reports will help you fit long, skinny queries on a single page; Group/Total is good for multiple groupings where you want to set off and summarize the groups)

In the dialog boxes that follow, pick "Query" as the table to use, Ledger style, add all fields, and horizontal layout. Enter "Night burglaries" as the title. Hit the "Preview" button, click on the preview page to zoom in, and you'll see that without much effort you've recreated the look of your query browse window, and you even have a nifty title at the top.

If you're satisfied, you could just close the preview window and "save and print" the report. To sample some of the real power of Report Writer, choose "Modify with Design Tool" and "Finish."

If you've ever used a graphics program or FoxPro's screen builder, you'll have an easier time with the report design screen. Everything you see is an "object" that can be created, dragged, resized or manipulated with the tools in the toolbar.

To see what I mean, click on the date field just under the title to select it-you'll see sizing handles appear around it. Hit delete and it disappears. Click the text tool - the capital A - and then click in the same area, and type "Phoenix metropolitan area, January 1993." Now, click on the arrow tool - the "object picker" – and select the text you just typed. Choose Object...Font. Experiment with different font sizes and types for the title.

If it's not lined up right, drag it into place.

Use the text tool to change the column headings to English and change the font if you wish.

Note that everything in the top Title Bar prints once, at the top of the first page, while the Page Header band prints under the title and atop any further pages. The Detail band prints for every record in your query. To make more room in a band, drag the buttons to the left of the band names. Notice that space is always added at the bottom-you can't directly add space at the top. To work around this, add room at the bottom, then double-click on the bar under the band, which will select all the objects inside. You can then drag them en masse to the bottom, giving you room at the top.

To cut down on white space or save room,

Reporter ISO love story

By Dave Sheingold
Westchester Rockland News
Dave Sheingold attended NICAR Bootcamp in July.
In the 1990s, age of enlightened thinking, it has been suggested that men and women are full of new insight into the ways of love and what makes each other tick.

Enter the computer to make Cupid's arrow land in the dirt.

Veering off course from the usual heavy duty CAR story, Gannett Newspapers in New York recently looked at an issue we knew everyone would read about — the personal ads — and put a new twist on it. We ran three month's worth of personal ads that appeared in our papers, which cover the northern New York City suburbs, to see what men and women said about themselves in the ads, what they said about their ideal mate and what it all meant, if anything.

The results? Not too encouraging.

Contrary to what we would like to believe, men and women remain on opposite sides of love's Grand Canyon. Neither side, it appears, is doing a whole lot of clear thinking about how to find love everlasting.

According to the most common words they use in their personal ads, men remain in search of Eve. The woman of their dreams can be a blast at parties and quick with a joke, but she better have a sweet smile and body to match or else she might get passed over. When it comes to luring a partner, men highlight a mix of their looks and their eclectic tastes, be they a love of fine food, good movies or the sporting life. Their inner self somehow gets second billing.

Women, meanwhile, were different. They saw the ideal male more for his personality than his looks. While a handsome gent is pretty cool, they said they'd prefer someone caring, romantic, witty and secure. But to bait him, they switched gears and played into the old stereotypes. They talked most about their looks before they mentioned that they were worldly, bright, eclectic and successful.

About the only hope that the differences may be narrowing was that both sexes listed long-term commitment as the No. 1 or 2 thing they were looking for.

As one social planning consultant who gives seminars on dating put it: "Men are still judging with their eyes, women with their hearts."

The bottom line, according to the experts, was that personals can work, but require patience, kind of like any other mating ritual.

Love match
This also could have been said for the computer process of getting from the raw text of the ads to the final results.

First, we got a list of 2,175 personals as ASCII text from the company that runs them in our papers. Three months was as far back as they kept them, so that's what we took.

The information imported into the Paradox database manager as one text field, so the next thing we needed to do was create a second field and retype the acronym for each ad placed (SWM for single white male, GWM for gay white male, SBPF for single black professional female, etc.) This sounds time consuming, but only took a few hours. We needed to do this so we could run queries on how many of the ad-placers were men or women, Jewish or Christian, gay or straight, professional or nonprofessional.

Then we separated the ads into different databases for males and females.

At that point, we needed to split the text of the male- and the female-placed ads into two fields --- one with the section of the ad describing what the ad-placer was like and the second describing what he or she was seeking in a mate.

There was no clear way of doing this. But we knew that almost all the ads began with the person's self-analysis while the second part was about their potential mate. That second part almost always began with ISO (in search of) or with words like 'desires,' 'seeks,' 'wants,' 'looking for' and similar types of verbs indicating a longing for that special person. This was where we wanted to split the text into two fields.

So, we separately exported the new male and female databases out as text and reopened them in Word Perfect. Using the search-and-replace function, we stuck an @ sign in front of every word we could think of that would split the ads into self-descriptions and desires.

Converting the edited text back to ASCII DOS, we re-imported each database into Paradox using

NICAR notes
Trucking, trucking, trucked
Neil Reisner, NICAR's training director, is leaving NICAR in January and taking a job at the Miami Herald as a computer-assisted reporter. After 37 seminars in 22 states (or was it 23?) and Canada, Neil and his family are moving from their New Jersey domicile to the more tropical surroundings in Broward County.

By Neil Reisner
NICAR staff
Call me Johnny Dataseed.
As NICAR's training director since January, I've spent my time wandering the country, scattering data, spreadsheets, and database managers wherever I've been.

It has (and few who know me will be surprised to find a Grateful Dead reference here) been a long, strange, and completely wonderful trip. In fact, I can't think of a better job.

What could be better than standing at the cutting edge of journalism and teaching excited and willing audiences how to do their jobs better? What could be better than getting on-site insight into newsrooms around the country? (And, given that I telecommuted to NICAR Central in Missouri from my home in New Jersey, what could be better than being more than 1,000 miles away from your boss?)

It's been a year of travel, averaging two weeks out of every month. The travel is both enjoyable and draining. It's hard to leave home and hearth that often. (It must be said, though, that the travel hasn't interfered that much. By the time this reflection sees print, my wife and I should be the proud parents of our first child.)

It's been a year of hanging out with journalists, all of whom were passionately interested in journalism and how to add computer-assisted reporting techniques to their arsenal of professional weapons. It's been a year of learning my craft better and learning how to teach it.

In some ways it's been a year of show biz — it's impossible to hold an audience for a two- or three- or five-day seminar without injecting a good deal of entertainment, stand-up comedy and bad puns.

And, most of all, it's been a year of working, even at long-distance, with the NICAR and IRE staffs, some of the most collegial, supportive, talented, committed and just plain decent people

IRE Notes
Executive Director Armao resigns
After three years, Rosemary Armao has resigned as IRE executive director to become Anne Arundel County bureau chief for the Baltimore Sun.

IRE is opening a national search to replace Armao, who resigned Nov. 1 in a letter to the group's board of directors and the dean of the Missouri School of Journalism. Explaining why she is leaving IRE, Armao said she can no longer ignore her strong desire to return to the practice of journalism.

She feels, she said, "an increasing homesickness for the newsroom." After nearly three years as executive director, a time "spent working with great reporters, reading wonderful journalism, and advocating in-depth journalism around the world," Armao said she is inspired. "Now its my turn to try to produce my own great journalism."

IRE, based at the University of Missouri-Columbia, is the leading educational organization for journalists who want to learn to do more thorough, better organized, and important stories. Armao was IRE's fifth executive director since it came into being 20 years ago with the revolutionary idea that journalists sharing their knowledge and skills would be a boon overall to the practice of reporting and editing.

Armao's tenure marks a dramatic increase in the programs and reach of IRE.
• The National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting (NICAR), a joint program of IRE and the Missouri School of Journalism, has held seminars and conferences training more than 8,000 journalists.

The personals
the @ sign as a delimiter. Now we had our two fields.

From there, we began running queries to count the number of times key words appeared in the ads. We figured out what words to look for simply by perusing a few dozen ads in the paper. We essentially divided up the results into categories of physical features, personality traits and other characteristics.

Key words involving looks included handsome, pretty, fit, tall, blond, and attractive. Personality traits included honest, loving, caring and sincere. Other characteristics were most often things like athletic, intelligent, financially secure and an interest in movies, sports, dining and travel.

You might think that these words were just stock, superficial things people would say or that they were exaggerated. But that didn't matter. We were most interested in the types of things people highlighted. That really told the story of what people think will attract a mate and the kinds of partners they seek.

Note that the results were not exact because not every single ad had the same format. A handful had to be discarded, so the results are somewhat general, open to a bit of interpretation.

But, hey, that's love, isn't it?

Reisner bids NICAR farewell
in journalism. (Although trying to fill the shoes of my predecessor, the extraordinarily talented and energetic Jennifer LaFleur was, at best, intimidating.)

It's been challenging in other ways, as well. Administration, organization and, most of all, patience, is not something that comes naturally to many reporters. And certainly not something that comes naturally to me.

But administration and organization is critical when you're on the road doing one seminar, planning the seminar you're going to lead next week, making contacts for the seminars you're going to do next month, answering e-mailed questions from the folks who attended the seminars you did last month, and overseeing seminars being led by other NICAR staff members and friends.

There have been other benefits. Meeting reporters, editors and news executives all over the country hasn't hurt professionally, as Jennifer Lafleur's move from this post to the San Jose Mercury News and mine to the Miami Herald clearly shows.

In all, it's been a blast. I recommend it to anyone.

Report Writer tips
To cut down on white space or save room, you can shorten the detail fields by dragging the sizing handles. Try shortening the Agency field by about half.
To make sure you're not truncating anything, double-click the field box to bring up the Report Expression dialog. Make sure the "Relative to Top-Field can stretch" option is checked (the Report Wizard should have automatically done this for you), and preview again. You should see the agency field shortened, and the few long names are wrapped to another line.

If you want some practice in dragging objects, follow up by resizing and dragging the other fields and headings to the left to take advantage of the extra space. The Report...Snap to Grid option should be checked to help you line things up-you may also use the arrow keys to move the selected object in small increments.

The Ledger format we chose puts a grid around the fields: you can drag these grid bars to accommodate the new sizes — or delete them. To draw these yourself, use the Rectangle tool to put a box around all the detail fields, then the Line tool (it looks like two intersecting lines) to draw vertical cell lines between fields.

The Field tool - a little box with ab inside - can be used to add a whole new field to the report. Let's try adding one that calculates the percentage of night burglaries among those in which the time is known.

Click on the Field tool, then in the Detail band where you want to place the new field. That brings up the Report Expression dialog box. Type this into the Expression box: night/ (night+day) * 100

Click OK to close the dialog, and you'll see your new field. Use the Text tool to type a percent sign just to the right of it. Choose Report...Page Preview to see the results.

Now, to print the report, you have to run the query again, with this additional tag at the bottom —
INTO CURSOR Query
REPORT FORM query.frx TO PRINTER NOCONSOLE
—subsituting the name of the.frx file where you saved the report. If you used RQBE to make the original query, you set the output to Report/ Label and check Options to bring up a dialog box where you can browse to the .frx file you made — and print the report.

You might instinctively try File...Print from the design screen, but if you do that, you'll print the code rather than the report. Remember, you're not designing a printout, you're designing a template for a printout. I guess this is meant for businesses who want a standard report form for an ever-changing database.

As you experiment with Report Writer's capabilities, here are a few of pitfalls to watch out for:
• You can make reports from joined database files rather than starting from a query. But watch out — the Report functions are not as sophisticated as SQL SELECT. You have to index and set the order of the linked (child) table to the joined field or you could get incorrect data.
• When you use functions to define a print field, as we did in the exercise, you can't mix data types. The whole field has to be character or numeric, or you get an error. So if you wanted to add the percent sign directly to the field above with +"%", it wouldn't work unless you first converted the number to a parsed character string with STR(ALLTRIM(numeric_function))
• If your data won't fit onto one page horizontally, and the space-gaining tricks above don't make enough room, you may pine for Excel's "Fit to Page" print option. Alternatively, you can set a smaller font size for your detail and header bands by double-clicking the bands to select everything, then choosing Object...Font
