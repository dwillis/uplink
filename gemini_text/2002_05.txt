Data additions:
The IRE and NICAR Database
Library completed two additions
of its government database col-
lection: the Department of
Transportation's database of
truck inspections and data files
from the Census Bureau's Fed-
eral Assistance Award Data
System (FAADS).

The truck inspections database
includes seven relational tables,
covering millions of inspections and
violations across the United States.
The library offers the data nation-
wide or by state.

The FAADS files include tables
for each fiscal year, covering
grants and other financial assis-
tance, including the recipient
and location, plus a description
of the program. FAADS files,
too, are offered both nationwide
or by state.

TRANSPORTATION
Databases highlight
tired truckers
By Greg Reeves, The Kansas City Star

Investigating fatigue among over-the-
road truckers last year was frustrating
work: we had to analyze not one, but
several databases, all of them missing
crashes and key pieces of information.
But when we were done, special
projects reporter Judy Thomas and I
were able to piece together enough
solid information to show the fatal con-
sequences of truckers driving tired.

In "Dead Tired," a three-day series that
ran in The Kansas City Star starting
Dec. 16, we reported that the long
hours truckers log on the road contrib-
uted to hundreds of deaths every year.

SPOTLIGHT: NICAR IN PHILADELPHIA
A conference report
By David Herzog, Missouri School of Journalism and NICAR

More than 400 journalists passionate
about computer-assisted reporting in
March gathered in Philadelphia to trade
tips, brush up on their skills and net-
work. With newsrooms across the
country slashing training budgets,
many of the journalists attending IRE
and NICAR's annual computer-as-
sisted reporting conference paid their
own way, and invested in their own careers.

Journalists packed 55 hands-on
classes, learning everything from ba-
sic spreadsheet skills to statistical
analysis and advanced programming
tricks. And they had the chance to
sample from more than five dozen pre-
sentations, panels and roundtable dis-

CAR projects garner
top honors

Sari Horwitz, Scott Higham and Sarah
Cohen of The Washington Post won a
prestigious Investigative Reporters and
Editors medal for exploring the deaths
of children in the District of Columbia.
For the same series, the Post team
won the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for investi-
gative reporting.

A student IRE Award went to Univer-
sity of Missouri School of Journalism
graduate Mary Jo Sylwester, now at the
Center for Public Integrity.

Both Sylwester and Post database
editor Cohen have worked with IRE
and NICAR. Cohen is a former train-
ing director for IRE and NICAR.
Sylwester, as a graduate student,
served as IRE and NICAR data library
administrator. She's now the database
editor for the Center for Public Integrity.

The Post team discovered that 229
children died during a seven-year pe-
riod after their dangerous family situa-
tions came to the attention of the
district's child protection system.

"The [ Post ] project,
which has resulted
in wide-ranging
reforms, answers
the highest call of
investigative
journalism."

Despite strict confidentiality laws, the
team pieced together records for 180
of those deaths, compiled them into a
database and found that one in five —
mostly infants and toddlers – lost their
lives after government workers failed
to take key preventive action or placed
the children in unsafe homes or institutions.

"The project, which has resulted in
wide-ranging reforms, answers the
highest call of investigative journalism,"
the IRE Award judges said in granting
the medal.

Sylwester won the student award for
"A Flood of Problems." Her package
for the Columbia Missourian exposed
problems with a local storm water per-
mitting system, the consequences for
residents and why readers should
care.

The May-June 2002 edition of The
IRE Journal includes a complete list-
ing of winners.

The annual awards of IRE – a 4,200
member professional organization —
recognize outstanding investigative
work in print, broadcast, online media
and for work furthering freedom of in-
formation.

The awards will be presented during a
June 1 luncheon at the IRE Annual
Conference in San Francisco. The con-
ference, scheduled for May 30-June 2
at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco,
will feature many of the winners speak-
ing about the techniques they used to
develop their stories.

Contest entries are screened and
judged by other working journalists.
The final judges this year included two
IRE board members and several IRE
members selected by the membership
and the board president.

CONSUMER REPORTING
Databases add depth to
pool stories
By Mike Sherry, IRE and NICAR

It's a good bet your news organization
will soon be doing the quick-hit pool
opening story. Why not add depth to
an otherwise shallow story?

You can do that - and many other sto-
ries — with U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission (CPSC) death and
injury data. The data should be manage-
able for anybody with a basic knowledge
of software such as Microsoft Access,
and you can get a decade's worth for free.

Along with swimming pools, the data
include incidents involving thousands
of other consumer products - from air
conditioners to vacuum cleaners.

Pool problems
Many of your readers, viewers or lis-
teners might not realize how danger-
ous swimming can be.

Of the more than 44,000 deaths in-
cluded in CPSC data running from
January 1990 to October 2001, more
than 5,300 records cited swimming
pools as the main product involved with
the death. Other oft-cited products in-
clude bathtubs and showers and stairs
and steps.

Swimming deaths increase when
slides and other related products are
taken into account. One entry in the
database - which is compiled from
state health department records - de-
tails the September 1998 death of a 3-
year-old girl in Tampa, Fla. She died
after tumbling from a pool slide, hitting
her head and falling into the water. The
table's four narrative fields provide a
detailed account of the incident.

CPSC's codes even get as specific as
categorizing deaths related to pool
chemicals (product code 938). The
death database includes eight in-
stances - in states as diverse as Cali-
fornia, New York and Wisconsin —
where pool chemicals contributed to a
death. In one incident, a 66-year-old
Cocoa Beach, Fla., woman died after
inhaling chlorine fumes.

From January 1990
to October 2001,
more than 5,300
records cited
swimming pools as
the main product
involved with
the death.

More than death data
The death database is just one of four
CPSC provides with data compiled in
the 1990s. (Data going further back is
available, but it is likely to cost you and
take longer for CPSC to provide). Also
available are:

• National Electronic Injury Surveil-
lance System (NEISS). Record
Count: 3,228,474. Conducted for
nearly 30 years, the survey currently
collects reports from 100 hospitals
nationwide. This survey is considered
a representative sample of emer-
gency rooms, allowing the CPSC to
estimate the number of injuries
caused each year nationwide by
products. The commission makes
these estimates available - in paper
format - through its annual "Product
Summary Reports." For example, the
2000 summary estimates there were
80,110 swimming pool-related inju-
ries that year. The 2001 summary
report should be available from the
commission in June or July.

Uplink

CPSC periodically alters its sample to
account for hospital closures and other
similar changes. The last change was
in 1997. Yet, CPSC statistician Tom
Schroeder said the commission's an-
nual estimates could be added to-
gether for a historical account of inju-
ries caused by a particular product. For
instance, it would be OK to add up the
CPSC estimates for swimming pool
injuries for each of 10 years and report
the number of injuries for the entire decade.

One caution, however; CPSC explic-
itly warns against saying these prod-
ucts "caused" the injuries. The commis-
sion says emergency room information
only tells the products that were "re-
lated" to the injury.

• Injury/Potential Injury Incident File
(IPII). Record Count: 222,396. This file
contains summaries of reports to the
agency's hotline, newspaper accounts,
reports from medical examiners and
letters to CPSC. Helpful fields in the
database include whether the injury
was work-related, a general descrip-
tion of the cause (such as an explo-
sion or fall), and the outcome of the
hospital visit (such as if the person was
treated and released, or dead on arrival).

• In-depth Investigations (INDP).
Record Count: 46,420. This file con-
tains summaries of investigations into
product-related injuries or incidents.
According to the CPSC, these investi-
gations are prompted by information
gathered for the NEISS or incident
tables or through a separate initiative
by the commission. Helpful fields in this
database include the body part injured
and injury diagnosis (such as poison-
ing or drowning).

Like the death data, the narrative
fields are one of the best features of
these three datasets. Additionally, the
IPII and INDP tables include the city
and state where the incident oc-
curred. Given that the NEISS is just
a sample, it does not include state or
city fields.

The incident and NEISS tables can be
linked with the investigation table

through a unique identifier known as
the task number.

Data documentation
Some of the key documents for these
datasets are readily available on the
Web. Those include an overview of
the NEISS database (www.cpsc.gov/
cpscpub/pubs/3002.html) and infor-
mation about obtaining the databases
(www.cpsc.gov/about/cIrnghse.html).

Also available is the very useful
"Product Code Comparability Table"
(www.cpsc.gov/Neiss/jove-asp/
default.htm), which documents the
changes in product codes throughout
the years. For instance, from 1972-
1978 the CPSC used code "1220" for
swimming and water sports equip-
ment. But, from 1978 on, it split that
code into three more-specific codes
— such as "3276" for water polo.

However, the record layouts sent with
the data were not great.

Problems included field names that
were out of order or were not in the
database at all. When Investigative
Reporters and Editors and the Na-
tional Institute for Computer-Assisted
Reporting obtained the data, we had
to call the CPSC for a code sheet
called "Interpretive Sheet for Com-
puter Printouts of Reported Inci-
dents." You should make sure you
request this with the data, since it
contains codes that help decipher
some of the fields.

Finally, the CPSC agreed to resend
us the data with updated record lay-
outs and code sheets.

The CPSC originally sent the data-
bases in a text format (delimited by "l")
that imported easily into Access. If you
ask, you should be able to get the data
as an Access database or as a .dbf.
The NEISS dataset came as four sepa-
rate text files; the other three data-
bases came as three individual text files.

Data come with caveats
When dealing with the age fields, keep
in mind that CPSC uses a three-digit
convention for children under the age
of 2. For example, a child that is 23
months old is listed in the data as "223."
Obviously, you'll want to keep this mind
if you're calculating average or median
ages, since the age cited in the ex-
ample would be read as a person who
is 223 years old.

Each of the four databases includes
multiple product fields. For instance,
the NEISS has "Prod1," "Prod2" and
"Prod3" fields. This does not mean that
Prod1 was the main product involved
with the injury and that the other two
were involved to a lesser extent. The
fields just tell which products were in-
volved with the injury or death.

CONSUMER REPORTING
Resources for consumer-
related stories
By lan Demsky, IRE and NICAR

IRE and NICAR offer several data-
bases, stories and tipsheets for report-
ers investigating consumer-related issues.

The Manufacturer and User Facility
Device Experience (MAUDE) data-
base from the Food and Drug Admin-
istration contains information about
problems that occurred with medical
devices. The problems include inju-
ries, deaths or product malfunctions.

The data include detailed narratives
about the device failures. Specific de-
vices can be searched to determine
how often they're reported to have
failed. Patient-specific and hospital-
specific information has been re-
moved for privacy reasons.

Several stories have been done us-
ing the data. For example, a 2000
Chicago Tribune investigation discov-
ered that because of understaffing
and a lack of training, nurses were
killing and injuring patients every
year. In 1992, U.S. News and World
Report examined medical devices
that concerned the FDA, including
breast, penile and testicular implants
as well as heart-bypass pumps and
cranial stimulators.

More health-care data
The National Practitioner Data Bank
from the Department of Health and
Human Services has information
about malpractice payments, licen-
sure, clinical privileges, professional
society membership and adverse ac-
tion reports concerning physicians,
dentists and other licensed health-
care professionals.

Practitioner- and hospital-specific in-
formation is excluded from the file.

Despite that, the Hartford Courant
used the data and a variety of public
records to examine several doctors
who continued to practice medicine
despite being sued for malpractice.
The Courant was able to focus on
several of the most dangerous doctors.

The New York Daily News revealed
15 of New York's most sued doctors
had between them 412 malpractice
suits, and their insurance firms had
spent more than $26 million in com-
pensation payments.

Vehicle complaints, recalls
The vehicle recalls and complaints
database from the National Highway
Transportation Safety Administration
contains information about vehicles
that have been recalled by manufac-
turers and consumer complaints
about them dating back to 1966.

Dateline used the
recalls data to
launch an
investigation
into "sudden
acceleration."

About 75 percent of recalls are initi-
ated by the manufacturers, because
of problems - identified or perceived
— with a vehicle. For the rest, NTSHA
contacts the manufacturer after re-
ceiving complaints, although the
agency itself never issues recalls on
its own.

Examples of the use of this database
include stories done by NBC News
Dateline and the Los Angeles Times.

Uplink

Dateline used the data to launch an
investigation into "sudden accelera-
tion," finding evidence that electrical
shorts, rather than people acciden-
tally stepping on the wrong pedal,
were to blame. The Times looked at
data concerning safety hazards that
contributed to the deaths of rear-seat
passengers in collisions.

SPOTLIGHT: NICAR IN PHILADELPHIA
Using census data for
non-census stories
By Paul Overberg, USA Today

If you're looking for local school sto-
ries, it's easy to be put off by this table:

P36. SEX BY SCHOOL ENROLL-
MENT BY LEVEL OF SCHOOL BY
TYPE OF SCHOOL FOR THE POPU-
LATION 3 YEARS AND OVER [47]

Universe: Population 3 years and over
Total:
Male:
Enrolled in nursery school, preschool:
Public school
Private school
Enrolled in kindergarten:

Private school
Enrolled in grade 1 to grade 4:

Enrolled in grade 5 to grade 8:

Enrolled in college, undergraduate
years:

Not enrolled in school
Female:
(Repeat)

This data will be published this sum-
mer for areas as big as states and as
small as block groups (a few hundred
homes) in Census 2000 Summary
File 3 data files. While it's not a good
idea to analyze data for block groups
— the data's too thin – the groups let
you build custom areas. Usually cen-
sus tracts, areas that average 1,500
homes, are the smallest standard ar-
eas worth analyzing. The school en-
rollment data list is a good example
of how census data can yield lots of
non-census stories — stories that
aren't just about basic demographic
trends like changes in population and
racial totals. The exercise below fo-
cuses on just this table, but you can
adapt the approach to any of them.

Doing your homework
There are 812 tables in SF3
(www.census.gov/population/www/
cen2000/SF3-pop.html and
www.census.gov/population/www/
cen2000/SF3-housing.html). Look at
tables for subjects that you care about
and think: "People asked to see this data
this way. What are they looking for?"

Think geographically
as well to use the
rich local detail
only the census
offers.

Invert your usual process. Instead of
looking at the data for stories, bring
your knowledge of a subject – like your
community's schools – to this data. See
if this data can back up or knock down
hunches and ideas. Look at its varia-
tions across your area. See if this data,
linked to local data on tax rates or test
scores or charter schools or atten-
dance zones or home prices, produces
new insight. You should also look at
what's not there, the way you'd ana-
lyze a story draft for holes.

It's fair to ask, "Why do I need census
enrollment data when I get it each year
from the school district?"

• Reason 1: No school superintendent
has all the data. Nationwide, one student
in eight attends private schools. And then
there's home schooling. Even states with
strong rules don't always require regis-
tration with the local district.

• Reason 2: School systems collect
data the way they need it – by school.
That doesn't help if you want to see it
by neighborhood. Or within 1.5 miles
of a school building.

• Reason 3: Annual data may be too
much. Census data from 1990 and
2000 lets you see broad patterns, and
in ways that are comparable around
the state and nation.

Preparing for possibilities
It's easy to see basic story possibili-
ties in the table above, like public-pri-
vate and male-female breakdowns in
local schools. But think geographically
as well to use the rich local detail only
the census offers. If you map these
ratios for each neighborhood, you will
see variations that could produce stories.

One way to get ready for the new data
is to get local data from the comparable
table in the 1990 Census, table P54 in
STF3:

P54. SCHOOL ENROLLMENT AND
TYPE OF SCHOOL [7]
Universe: Population 3 years and over
Enrolled in preprimary school:
Public school
Private school
Enrolled in elementary or high school:
Public school
Private school
Enrolled in college:
Public school
Private school
Not enrolled in school

You can probably get local P54 data
from planners, school officials or the
state data center. You can also down-
load it. Browse to http://
factfinder.census.gov, click on "Data
sets" and follow the instructions.

The 1990 table is less detailed, but you

6
May • June 2002
==End of OCR for page 6==

==Start of OCR for page 7==
can collapse 2000 categories to match.

When 2000 data arrives
• Who's not there: If you subtract an
area's population age 18 and over
and ages 3 to 5 from the sum of the
two "not enrolled" categories, you get
kids ages 5 to 18 who aren't in any
school. How many? Are they home-
schooled? Nationwide, about 1.7 per-
cent of kids 5 to 17 were home-
schooled in 1999 (http://nces.ed.gov/
pubs2001/HomeSchool/) but that
rate varies widely. Dropouts? (http://
nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/
pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2002114)
Where are they – clustered or scat-
tered? If you want to focus on drop-
outs, check another table, P38. Set
up mostly to track potential military
recruits, it nonetheless tells you how
many people ages 16 to 19 are drop-
outs and their employment status.

• Private school popularity: What's the
ratio of public vs. private in grades 1-4
-compared to grades 5-8 and grades 9-
12? One index of a public school sys-
tem in trouble is people leaving as their
kids get older. In particular, calculate
the public-private ratio for each neigh-
borhood and map it, even if it's just
using crayons on paper. See any sur-
prises? How well do you know your
private schools? At the National Cen-
ter for Education Statistics web page
http://nces.ed.gov/globallocator, check
"private schools," punch in a local ZIP
and a 20-mile radius. Use the links to
find enrollment data.

• Starting earlier: Over the last 10
years, nursery schools have swelled.
Compare 1990 and 2000 totals and
public school-private school market
share splits in each year. You might find
overall increases even though birth
rates in most areas dropped from 1990
to 1995, cutting the number of 4- and
5-year-olds from 1995 to 2000.

• Middle-age students: Look how many
are enrolled in graduate or professional
programs. You might be surprised —
distance education, weekend and night
programs are boosting middle-age en-
rollments. If you want to delve more
into the age breakdown of local stu-
dents, see tables PCT23 and PCT24
(www.census.gov/population/www/
cen2000/SF3-pop.html#seea3).

• College town: You may know the en-
rollment of the local college, but where
are the students? This table will tell
you. You probably know the obvious
undergrad neighborhoods near cam-
pus, but look at the change since 1990,
both in density and extent. Grad stu-
dents, who tend to be less raucous and
more settled, will probably show a dif-
ferent pattern.

• Commuter colleges: Your town has
colleges you probably don't think
much about – community colleges,
technical and trade schools, etc. Look
to see where the most college stu-
dents live away from known college
neighborhoods. They're probably
working-class and immigrant neigh-
borhoods with lots of hopes and
dreams and not much money. Where
are those students enrolled?

• Magnet and charter schools: They're
growing in popularity and steadily
scrambling the neighborhood school
picture. It's quite possible to find sub-
urban neighborhoods where kids go to
five different elementary schools. What
does this do to neighborhood life?

• Race and enrollment: How different
is the racial profile of your district from
the public school enrollment? Or a
school's attendance zone from its ac-
tual student body? NCES has
summed Census 2000 race/ethnicity
data for 8 million census blocks to get
totals for 14,400 districts nationwide.
The data is tallied for the total popu-
lation and the population 18 and over,
so you can subtract to get kids up to
17. Start at http://nces.ed.gov/sur-

1990s saw school segregation grow
in most places. (See

• Striving: Take the private school en-

rollment percentage for every neigh-
borhood you cover from this table.
Take the poverty rate percentage
from P87 or P90. Put them in Excel
and make a scatter-plot graph, so that
each pair is plotted as a dot. You'll
see a pretty logical pattern – higher
private school enrollment corre-
sponds with lower poverty rates. But
you'll see some dots standing out
from the cluster – where a relatively
poor neighborhood has a relatively
large private school enrollment.
What's going on there?

Cautionary notes
about SF3 data

1. This data comes from the
census long form, which about
one household in six fills out. If the
school enrollment question isn't
answered despite the best efforts
of census-takers, the Census
Bureau will use rules it has tested
to fill in the database on known
characteristics of the household
and its neighborhood. To see what
percentage of any area you're
studying has this imputed data for
this question, see table P110.

2. Because this data comes from
a survey, each number has a little
cloud of uncertainty around it, just
like an opinion poll. We usually
call these "error margins." The
smaller the geographical area
you're studying, the bigger the
cloud is relative to the totals. Make
sure you're not overstating what
the data says by understanding
that error margin. Use the SF3
documentation to compute the
applicable margin, or get help
from a local statistics professor.

SPOTLIGHT: NICAR IN PHILADELPHIA
Intranet tools and
preparing for disaster
By Tom Torok, The New York Times

The New York Times taxed traditional
reporting tools to the limit shortly af-
ter the first plane slammed into the
World Trade Center.

Within 24 hours, more than 600 files
of story notes accumulated in the
newsroom's Atex computer system
metro queue. There were more related
files in the foreign, national and busi-
ness queues. Searching for any snip-
pet of information became increasingly
difficult and slow as torrents of infor-
mation poured in.

Some reporters tried other means of
organization. One started a spread-
sheet to track suspects that soon
grew to monstrous proportions. The
spreadsheet was difficult to read and
almost impossible to print. Attempts
to share the spreadsheet over the
network compounded the
unwieldiness.

A terrorism team was assembled and
editors had trouble tracking more than
80 reporters and their assignments,
phone numbers and e-mail addresses.

I didn't know it at the time, but I had an
intranet ready for a story of the magni-
tude of Sept. 11.

Managing the information
A web application to search the accu-
mulating notes was ready the next
morning.

A virtual online newsroom began to
take shape by the second afternoon,
with applications that allowed lightning-
fast searches of accumulated notes,
suspects, reporters, phone numbers —
anything that involved Sept. 11. Report-
ers and editors could add or update
information whenever they wanted,
from wherever they wanted.

The intranet within an intranet wasn't
always the perfect tool — no such tool
exists for what had happened – but it
did help significantly in managing in-
formation.

In all, about 20 pages were created to
deal with the coverage. But with the ex-
ception of one of those 20 pages, I ei-
ther already had similar pages that could

Monday, April 15
The [British] Ministry of Defence has placed a step-by-step guide on how to build an
atomic bomb in the Public Record Office for anybody to see, The [London] Daily Telegraph.
It has also released a file describing various ways in which such a bomb could be smuggled into the
country. There are complete cross-sections, precise measurements and full details of the materials
used for all the components of the first British bomb, including the two key parts: the plutonium core
and the initiator that sets off the chain reaction causing the blast. The plans, seen by The Telegraph
and available to anybody of any nationality, are contained in files released over the past five years.
They would enable a terrorist to make an atomic bomb without difficulty, according to an engineer

be modified to suit the task or had a pro-
gram ready to write the code needed.

Every "borrowed" Web page needed
tinkering – some needed extensive re-
writes – but anything I had on hand was
better than starting from scratch. And
what I had on hand was a virtual news-
room waiting for a project.

Many of the pages were written for
coverage of the 2000 national party
conventions, where they were never
used. The Sept. 11 pages were better
received than the convention pages. In
the first two months, the newsroom
was calling up those related pages
between 2,200 and 2,600 times a day.

Pages for preparation
Rather than enumerate which pages
the Times used for Sept. 11 coverage,
let's concentrate on pages that you
should have ready for the next break-
ing story or project, be it big or small.
To start, you want to prepare four
pages to display information:

1. A news-brief or announcements
page on which information important
to the project can be posted.

2. A whereabouts page that will allow any-
one involved in the project to find reporters,
editors and assignments quickly.

3. A text-search page to search col-
lected text or HTML documents related
to the project.

4. An events page to track events re-
lated the project, such as press con-
ferences or meetings.

Before you create a monster, ask your-
self some questions about these pages.

Who will keep them current? Who can
add breaking information? Who can
delete information? Who can edit em-
barrassing typos? If all answers point
to you, you're heading for trouble be-
fore you start.

Take a look around the newsroom. A
good look. Is there anyone who can edit
a Web page while you're sleeping, on

8
May • June 2002
==End of OCR for page 8==

==Start of OCR for page 9==
vacation or on deadline? Probably not.

As important as you are to your
newsroom's computer-assisted re-
porting efforts, you are not indispens-
able. In fact, you will become a bottle-
neck if your intranet cannot be
brought up to date without you. Tal-
ented writers and news gatherers
surround you. Why not marshal their
talents to help? Probably all but two
people in your newsroom can type
into a Web input box. (The other two
can't do anything with computers.
Accept that and get on with life.)

Code-writing
programs also are
invaluable for
making interactive
forms for
databases

To bring more hands into the process,
try following a few guidelines that will
help keep your intranet current:

• Guideline 1. Do not post anything on
your intranet unless there is some
mechanism (or persons in addition to
yourself) in place to keep the informa-
tion current.

• Guideline 2. Whenever possible, con-
struct information pages so they are
fully and easily editable by any persons
you choose at anytime they choose.

We're taking it as a given that no one
else in your newsroom knows HTML,
so we've got to add a few more guide-
lines to make 1 and 2 practical:

• Guideline 3. Use databases to drive
virtually all of your content that is not
archived text.

• Guideline 4. Use interactive templates
to display the contents of the databases.

With these guidelines in mind, you'll
need one more page in your basic
package to allow selected users to
upload new text files for your text
search page. You'll also need at least
three more pages to make the an-
nouncements, whereabouts and
events pages fully editable on the Web.
The interactive templates for the latter
tasks are complicated, tedious to build
and difficult to debug. In that light, con-
sider another guideline:

• Guideline 5. Use one or more pro-
grams to create the code to display
database content and/or to make da-
tabase content fully editable on the Web.

Such programs would be useful in
creating your four basic pages and
the pages that are used to edit them.
(A quick way to allow others to up-
load text via the Web is a program
called SA-FileUp which you can
sample at www.softartisans.com).
Code-writing programs also are in-
valuable for making interactive forms
for databases that you are creating
on the fly, as we did at the Times for
victims, suspects, detainees and
chronologies.

Choosing the software
There are a variety of excellent ways
to serve up the pages and the data.
Software and hardware have evolved
to the point where communications
between Web pages and databases
are so robust that even pages with
multiple complicated queries will work
every time.

If at all possible, I would avoid using a
desktop application, such as Microsoft
Access or FoxPro, as database serv-
ers. They'll work in low-volume situa-
tions, but they will not match the per-
formance and ease of administration
of a dedicated database server, such
as Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle or
MySQL (which is free).

Many professionals at high-volume
Web sites prefer Web servers that op-
erate in Unix/Linux-like environments,
but most newsrooms are using either
Cold Fusion or Microsoft Internet In-
Uplink

formation Server (or both) for their
intranets because of relative ease of
use in a PC environment. Vastly im-
proved versions of FileMaker Pro also
are gaining popularity in both PC and
Macintosh environments.

Cold Fusion and FileMaker Pro have
the shortest learning curves. Cold Fu-
sion has been used to create excellent
interactive sites at The Seattle Times,
the St. Paul Pioneer Press and else-
where. Server versions start at about
$1,300. FileMaker starts at about
$1,000 for server versions.

If you have Windows 2000 Profes-
sional, you have enough free soft-
ware to start a small intranet (10 con-
current users) with text-searching ca-
pabilities.

The learning curve can be quite steep
to use Active Server Pages, the pro-
grammable pages used with
Microsoft's Web server. Some jour-
nalists with little or no programming
skills have had success creating in-
teractive pages with Microsoft's
FrontPage, which is packaged with
premium versions of Microsoft Office.

I've written Web-based applications
that will create Active Server Pages
for database searching and database
editing (updates, deletes, additions
as well as searches). I've also modi-
fied Microsoft's sample text-search-
ing pages so they can be quickly de-
ployed in your newsroom. (These are
available at: www.nicar.org/
techtips.html.)

Whichever platform you choose to host
your intranet, you should immediately
create a package of the pages recom-
mended here and then, make two cop-
ies. While making the copies, take ex-
tensive notes in a text document that
details which changes are needed to
create new packages. That way, you'll
be ready for two new projects immedi-
ately and you will be able to deal with
any new projects that follow.

SPOTLIGHT: NICAR IN PHILADELPHIA
Measuring your local
economy
By John Byczkowski, The Cincinnati Enquirer

Your editor asks, "How's the local
economy?" What your editor probably
means is "Is the local economy ex-
panding, standing still or contracting?
Is business in a mood to expand? Are
consumers in a mood to spend?"

You'll find that there's actually a fair
amount of data out there about local
economic activity. The challenge is
whittling it down to a manageable
number of key indicators that you can
obtain reliably, and then track regularly.

These nine indicators should be ob-
tainable on a monthly basis for just
about anywhere in the country:

Employment - total non-agricultural
wage and salary, manufacturing, new
unemployment claims

Construction — new home starts
(number of starts, rather than dollar
value), nonresidential construction
(dollar value of building permits)

Spending - retail sales

Production - average weekly hours,
manufacturing, industrial electricity sales

Getting the data
• Employment data: The pace of job
growth is probably the best eco-
nomic-health indicator, not to men-
tion consumer confidence. Con-
sumers don't spend if they don't
feel secure in their jobs. Start at
www.bls.gov/data/home.htm. This
is the gateway to the huge stores
of data at the Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics, U.S. Department of Labor.
You'll be able to get data - in some
cases down to the county level —
stretching back as far as the 1940s.
Focus on this section: "State and
Area Employment, Hours, and
Earnings." You'll find numbers on
total employment, manufacturing
employment and average work
week. That will help you get the his-
torical databases set up, but new
data - as it's issued — will come
from your state's agency that col-
lects labor market information. Ask
for a schedule of release dates and
ask what other data are collected.
Talk to an expert before you use data
older than 1990.

The pace of job
growth is probably
the best economic-
health indicator,
not to mention
consumer
confidence.

• New unemployment claims: One of
the few "leading" indicators you'll get
on a local level. Check with your
state's employment agency and ask
about unemployment compensation
data. Many states can provide this
data weekly. It's unlikely that the data
will be totaled for your Metropolitan
Statistical Area, so you may have to
add it up yourself.

The data typically report how many
people file claims at particular offices,
but keep in mind also that many
states are switching to telephone re-
porting systems, so try to find data
on the people who file claims by
phone in your area.

• New home starts: Strong activity
means jobs for builders and reflects
consumers' willingness to make long-
term financial commitments. Check
with your local homebuilders associa-
tion. A state agency might also provide
this.

• Commercial (nonresidential) con-
struction: Activity here means jobs for
construction workers and reflects the
willingness of business to invest and
expand. The F.W. Dodge division of
the McGraw-Hill Construction Infor-
mation Group is the main source of
data on construction activity. The di-
vision issues press releases monthly
with construction totals for nonresi-
dential construction. That includes
manufacturing, commercial, educa-
tion and medical buildings.

One caveat: The totals in the press
releases are preliminary and you
don't get the final number until the
next year. The revisions can be as
much as 50 percent, but this is the
best available data. Contact F.W.
Dodge PR at 212-904-2439, or Bob
Murray, VP economic affairs, 781-
860-6623.

• Retail sales: The U.S. Commerce
Department used to provide these fig-
ures but stopped doing that around
1996. If you have a local sales tax,
you might be able to get those col-
lections from your state's taxation
department or local government.

• Industrial electricity sales. This re-
flects the level of manufacturing ac-
tivity in your area. Ask your local elec-
trical utility if they'd provide this for
you. My local utility folks used to pro-
vide me with the figure in kilowatt
hours, but today they provide an in-
dex so they don't have to disclose
Kwh. They can also break this down
by type of industry.

Using the data
• Chart it. You'll understand it better
if you visualize it.

• Run comparisons. Keep in mind al-
most all the data you get will not be
seasonally adjusted. That means you

10
May • June 2002
==End of OCR for page 10==

==Start of OCR for page 11==
can't really compare February's num-
bers to January's; you have to com-
pare them to February a year ago.

• Calculate change both as percent-
age change and nominal change.
Data will be clearer to the reader.
When writing, you say the economy
created 10,000 new jobs rather than
say the number of jobs grew 2 percent.

Other data measuring
local economy

1. The unemployment rate
While it's less important than the
rate at which the number of jobs
is growing (or not growing), the
unemployment rate is still worth
knowing. Keep in mind you
local rate may not be seasonally
adjusted, which means it's no
comparable to the national rate
A national unadjusted rate is
available at http:/
stats.bis.gov.

2. Browse Census Quickfacts
http://quickfacts.census.gov
qfd/ for state and county
business information.

3. The Economic Census: Every
five years the Census Bureau
does an economic census, anc
it gives a great picture o
business in your area. Trouble
is the last one was 1997. The
next one will be done this
December, and the data will be
released starting in 2004.

4. Read the Beige Book. It's a
the Federal Reserve Web site
• Calculate year-to-year change. Run
a 12-month moving average and
chart it against the main data line.
This will smooth out seasonal
changes and allow you to see trends.

• Calculate a year-to-date total and
change from a year earlier. This is
helpful with indicators that are cumu-
lative, such as construction or unem-
www.federalreserve.gov,
under "Monetary Policy." You'll
get story ideas about current
economic conditions in your region.

5. Bureau of Economic Analysis:
www.bea.doc.gov. There's a
"State and Local Area Data"
section, and check for more data
under "Publications."

6. Commercial real estate:
Somebody in your area is tracking
commercial and industrial
properties, watching vacancy
rates and rents. Most surveys of
this type are done quarterly.

7. Notices of big layoffs: Your
state should be able to provide
these to you. Are big layoffs
increasing in your area?

8. Manpower survey: A quarterly
survey of company hiring plans.
Contact Manpower in Milwaukee
at 414-961-1000.

9. Economic Cycle Research
Institute: 212-557-7788 and talk
to Anirvan Banerji, director of
research (ext. 11), or Julienne
Kim, publications manager (ext.
10). Alternatively, go to
www.businesscycle.com. This
used to be part of Columbia
University and pioneered leading
indicators.

Uplink

ployment claims. Be mindful of revi-
sions in the data. Labor data is re-
vised every March for the previous
two years. As mentioned above, the
construction data can be substantially
revised.

Analysis of the data
Analysis is tough for a lot of reasons.
If you're collecting data for March,
you'll have some in April but you won't
have all of it until the end of May. Also,
it's sometimes tough to know exactly
what these indicators are indicating.

All this makes it difficult, for instance,
to build a local economic index. Think
your readers will be interested in June
to see your March index?

Instead, the data is a conversation
starter. The best you can do is eye-
ball it, get a sense of where things
are going and who's most affected
and begin your reporting.

MAPPING
IT OUT

This is a new Uplink feature
that shows off analytic maps
created by journalists for their
news reporting.

Plotting race
by population

Census 2000 provided journal-
ists a once-in-a-decade oppor-
tunity to explore racial popula-
tion patterns in their communi-
ties. Using geographic informa-
tion systems (GIS) and census
data, journalists across the
country mapped the population
patterns of blacks and whites,
looking for segregation and mi-
gration. As you can see from the
examples on these pages, jour-
nalists took different approaches

in their mapping, but all found in-
teresting stories.

'Cost of Segregation'
Gordon Trowbridge of The De-
troit News created two dot-den-
sity maps of the Detroit metro-
politan area to explore segrega-
tion between blacks and whites
in 2000 for a special report, "The
Cost of Segregation." (See the
report at http://
pc99.detnews.com/
specialreports/index.hbs).
Trowbridge used ArcView to plot
each race on the separate
maps, with one dot representing
100 people inside a census
tract. (See Map 1 for white and
Map 2 for black). The juxtaposi-
tion of these two maps — later
dressed up for print — clearly
showed readers the high segre-
gation in the city of Detroit.
Trowbridge says that the maps
were useful internally in helping
editors understand the severity
of segregation.

Trends in 'tipping'
Jeff Hansen of the Birmingham
(Ala.) News, used ArcView data
to examine "tipping" - shifts of
20 percent or more in the per-
centage of black or white popu-
lation. Hansen's map (Map 3)
here shows the city of Birming-
ham as a black outline and the
tipped city block groups as
white. The block groups outside

the city that tipped are shown as
gray. Digging deeper into the
data, Hansen found that about
one in 11 people in Alabama live
in an area that saw a steep ra-
cial change during the 1990s.
The mapping also led Hansen to
two interesting trends: First,
middle-class black families mov-
ing out of older, smaller homes,
to larger, new homes on the
city's east side. Second, surges
in white population in former ru-
ral black areas where subdivi-
sions had since sprouted.

Tracking racial shifts
Tim Henderson, a database edi-
tor at the Miami Herald, looked
at black population shifts a little
differently. He used ArcView to
map the places in Dade and
Broward counties where blacks
had left during the 1990s and
where they went. (See Map 4)
After some trial and error,
Henderson settled on these defi-
nitions for shading the map:
Places that had been at least 20
percent black in 1990 and lost
10 percent or more of its popu-
lation during the decade was
shaded as "left." Places where
the population increased by 10
percentage points during the de-
cade were shaded as "went."
The resulting ArcView layout,
Henderson says, shows that
blacks tended to move out of the
older, inner-city neighborhoods

POLICE SHOOTINGS
Gunning for safety
By Brian D. Crecente and Sarah Huntley, Rocky Mountain News

When the Denver Police Department
landed on The Washington Post's na-
tional 10 worst list for police shooting
fatality rates, department officials were
outraged.

They said the numbers weren't a fair
comparison and painted a picture of the
department that wasn't true.

A three-month investigation by the
Rocky Mountain News found, that
while the fatality rates could indeed be
construed as misleading, the
department's system for tracking po-
lice-involved shootings is a secretive
and outdated process that is protected
by police unions, the department's top
brass and city hall.

The search for data started at the
Denver's District Attorney's Office.

The legwork
The district attorney reviews all police
shootings that result in significant in-
jury or death to determine whether the
officer should be charged with a crime.
After making a determination about
whether to prosecute, the district
attorney's office issues a lengthy and
detailed decision letter.

When the letter is released, so are
the investigative files. The files, which
include police reports, written state-
ments and videotaped accounts
given by officers and witnesses, were
a data gold mine.

We requested all of the decision let-
ters going back to 1990 and then spent
the next month poring over the letters,
making notes and highlighting relevant
information.

We decided early on to let the data
dictate what stories we would be writ-
ing, so we created a basic Access da-
tabase and frequently modifying it to
meet our emerging needs.

Tailoring a database
The first database we created had
fields for the basics about the incident,
the person who was shot and details
on up to six officers.

After reading a half-dozen reports, we
decided to add a few yes/no
checkboxes to the database. We
wanted to know how many of those
shot were on drugs or drunk when the
shooting happened and how many
showed signs of possible mental ill-
ness. We created other checkboxes
to denote when an officer had a gun
pointed or fired at him and if the of-
ficer or a civilian felt the person shot
threatened them.

All of this data, while open to inter-
pretation, came directly from the de-
cision letters. The only exception to
that rule was a yes/no box created to
show if we thought the shooting was
questionable. We used that to help
highlight the cases that we needed
to go back and re-read and eventu-
ally pull the entire case files for.

As we went through the data, we also
decided to create fields for a descrip-
tion of the civilian's weapon and later
a generic description for the weapon.
So, in time, an unloaded pearl-handled
22-caliber Rohm revolver became a gun.

We did the same thing for the events
leading up to the shooting. Each inci-
dent had a brief description of an inci-
dent and then a matching field that
used a generic version to help us cat-
egorize the cases.

There was some data we entered but
never used.

We included the number of times a
person was shot, but after reading
through 86 letters decided the informa-
tion wasn't accurate enough to include.
The same held true for the location of
the injuries.

Quality control
By the time the database was complete
we had a file that was as wide as it
was long, with 86 records each with 76
different fields.

Once the database was created, we

decided to run it by the police depart-
ment to make sure we had all of the
incidents that happened over the past
decade.

The problem was that the department's
policy, which leaned heavily on state
law, restricts meaningful access to of-
ficer discipline.

The department finally agreed to check
our data by comparing our list of every
officer we felt was involved in a shoot-
ing with their internal affairs records.

Over the next few weeks, we were able
to find a handful of missing cases and
finally completed an accurate list of
officers involved in shootings that the
police and we agreed upon.

At first, department officials provided
us only with a numerical breakdown of
officers disciplined in connection with
shootings, refusing to give us the ac-
tual names of the officers or specifics
about the cases.

As we continued to probe, however, we
learned that the department had cre-
ated a spreadsheet of cases reviewed
by the Firearms Discharge Review
Board, an internal group made up of
the department's top officials.

We had already done extensive re-
search on the discharge review board
and determined it would play a major
part in our stories. The board is sup-
posed to review every police shooting,
including those that do not result in any
injuries, and come to a conclusion
about whether an officer followed de-
partmental policy. Our study had found
that the board rarely conducted any ad-
ditional independent investigation.

The department faxed over a com-
plete list of every officer involved in
a shooting, whether the officer was
disciplined and the discipline re-
ceived. The list didn't include names
of officers, but did have the dates the
incident happened and a brief de-
scription of each incident.

After a little cajoling, officials agreed
to e-mail the list over as an Excel file.
We converted it to an Access data-
base and then cross-referenced the
data using the date.

Finally we went through each case in-
dividually and double-checked that the
descriptions matched.

With the help of staff writer Peggy
Lowe, we published seven articles in
a two-day series.

The results are in
Our analysis found:
• From 1990 to 2000, Denver police
shot 91 people, killing 35. The city has

Uplink

paid nearly $3.7 million to settle law-
suits and claims filed by the injured and
the families of the dead.

• Of the 126 officers who shot people,
five were disciplined. The most seri-
ous punishment was a three-day sus-
pension plus a one-day fine. In four
of the cases, the officers were penal-
ized not for shooting a person, but for
shooting at a car.

• More than a third of the people shot
were mentally ill, high on drugs or al-
cohol or acting irrationally in the mo-
ments before officers fired. Only seven
survived. Denver police are planning
to implement a new crisis intervention
program in hopes of lowering these
types of shootings in the future.

• The Denver Police Department does
not have a comprehensive, computer-
ized method for tracking officers or
identifying possible problems. A deputy
chief said the current system is a
"hodgepodge" that relies upon institu-
tional memory and occasional reporting.

• The city's only citizen watchdog
group, the Public Safety Review Com-
mission, has failed to bring meaning-
ful oversight to police shootings. The
group's advocates say the accountabil-
ity process is stymied by politics, a lack
of funding for full-time investigators and
a growing caseload.

Community response
We worked with our online team to put
a searchable form of the database up
on our Web site and to publish a map
that showed the location of every
shooting and details of each. (see
screenshots on this and previous page.)

Putting the database online required
stripping out some information, renam-
ing fields to better explain what they
were supposed to represent and de-
ciding how best to allow readers to
search the voluminous information.

The stories received mixed feedback,
with some saying it was time someone
took a closer look at law enforcement
conduct and others accusing us of

E-PANELS
Building databases
of sources
By Jim Hopkins, USA Today

It's 7:05 p.m. The deadline for your
story about the tumbling stock market
is an hour away. At the last minute, your
editor wants quotes from "real people"
– investors whose panic-stricken reac-
tion will add color. Now what?

You could grab the telephone book and
make random calls, hoping to find
someone with an articulate, punchy quote.

A better-prepared reporter would turn
to a list of investors' names and phone
numbers who've already agreed to be
called in just such a situation. The list
— let's call it a panel – might be
scribbled out on paper or kept in a com-
puter file.

But the best-prepared reporters will
turn to what I call an "e-panel" — a
searchable database of investors'
names, phone numbers and other
identifying information: Gender. Race.
Age. Annual income. Occupation. In-
vestment goals. And perhaps most
important, e-mail addresses.

Now technology makes it easier than
ever for newspapers and other media
to create these sorts of databases, then
mine them for trends and other story
ideas. Best of all, an e-panel can be
built with minimal effort using software
such as Excel, already available in
many newsrooms.

Of course, e-panels don't have to be
limited to stock market investors. Imag-
ine you had a database of teen-agers
to ask questions about music, fashion
or peer pressure. Other topics: con-
sumers, sports fans, TV viewers, fre-
quent travelers. The sky's the limit.

E-panel on deadline
As USA Today's entrepreneurs re-
porter, I couldn't do my job without our
Small Business Panel. It comprises
2,100 U.S. companies, with e-mail ad-
dresses, phone numbers, annual rev-
enue, location, number of employees
and other identifying information – all
stored in an Excel spreadsheet.

The panel was indispensable on Sept.
11, when we were writing stories about
the terrorist attacks. I work in our San
Francisco bureau. At 8:14 a.m. Pacific
time that day, I sent 150 e-mails to com-
panies asking how the tragedy affected
them. Within minutes, the first of nearly
50 replies poured into my laptop. They were
rich with quotes that I immediately fired off
to our lead reporter on the East Coast.

Technology made
it easy to build the
Small Business
Panel

Business consultant Anna Bernstein e-
mailed from Manhattan: "If you go out
on the street, it's strangely quiet. Busi-
ness people all over the sidewalks at
noon and no one speaking." Without
our Small Business Panel, I would
have spent hours of cold calling to find
someone like Bernstein at ground zero.
And anyway, phone circuits were tied
up; e-mail was the only way I could
communicate.

Another example: For a story about
access to venture capital, I needed a
half-dozen specific kinds of businesses
— very young companies started by
women. In the past, I would have called
trade groups and other sources for a
couple of days. Instead, I searched our
Small Business Panel database for all
women-led companies open three
years or less. That produced a list of
128 firms. I copied their e-mail ad-
dresses into a single Microsoft Outlook
e-mail form. Then I wrote one e-mail
asking the firms if they fit my criteria. I
included a deadline for replies, and
wham! fired off 128 copies.

The entire process took less than 15
minutes. Within 24 hours, I had seven
perfect replies. And as you can see,
by storing the panel in a spreadsheet,
I could quickly slice and dice the con-
tents to find companies that were likely
matches.

Gathering the data
Technology made it easy to build the
Small Business Panel because we
used USA Today's print edition and
Web site to gather names. A note pub-
lished in the Money section directed
readers to a USA Today Web page with
an electronic survey form. Readers
filled in e-mail addresses, phone num-
bers and other information. Responses
were saved in a text file that was then
easily imported into Excel.

Many newspapers may need to use a
more traditional approach - asking
readers to complete an in-paper sur-
vey form, then mailing it to the news-
room. Information from the forms can
then be entered into an Excel or simi-
lar database by hand.

Tips on how to create your own e-panels:

• Get tech advice. Talk to the person
who maintains your newspaper's Web
site to see if they can build an online
survey form.

• Plan ahead. Imagine the kind of sto-
ries you hope to draw from your e-
panel then reflect that in your in-paper
or online survey form. Example: I knew
I would be searching the Small Busi-
ness Panel for manufacturers or retail-
ers, so our form asked people to
specify their industry.

SPOTLIGHT: NICAR IN PHILADELPHIA
Tracking campaign
donors through City Hall
By Bob Warner, Philadelphia Daily News

If you're a reporter covering city hall
or state government, maintaining da-
tabases on political contributors is es-
sential. In most places, you can't re-
ally understand what's happening in
local government or politics without
knowing who is financing the campaigns.

Reforms at the federal level might
push even more political money into
state and local coffers, so you've got
to develop a strategy to track it. Here
are a few suggestions.

In city hall or your county seat, spend
some time in whatever office is re-
sponsible for maintaining campaign
finance data. Try to get to know the
people who file away all the reports
- it's a thankless job, and the people
who do it well are probably just as
shocked as you at the amount of
money now influencing the political
process. No matter how good your
databases are, you'll occasionally
need help from real humans tracking
down paper records. Prepare a list
of all the public officials you're inter-
ested in and take a fast look at their
most recent reports. Make sure
they're up to date, and figure out
which ones are already using comput-
ers to prepare their paper filings.

If your employer will pay for it, you
can hire someone to input data into
your own databases. If not, you've
got two choices: start typing yourself,
or call the pols, asking them to share
the donor data that they've already
fed into their own computers. At first
blush, this may go against your grain.
Nobody wants to ask favors from the
people they cover. But that's the
wrong way to look at it. This is no
personal favor. Your public officials
are asking city contractors and other
people to give them hundreds or
thousands of dollars. All you're ask-
ing them to do is facilitate public dis-
closure of their fund-raising. Surely
they have no objection to that, do
they? If they do, ask them to explain
it. Very few will be willing to say for
the record that they want to obscure
the names of their contributors.

In Pennsylvania, the major candi-
dates for governor, mayor and other
major offices are now usually coop-
erative and provide the news media,
voluntarily, with diskettes or e-mail
attachments identifying their con-
tributors and campaign expenses.
When they're disclosing $10 million
worth of donations at 4:55 on a week-
day afternoon, you'll have a hard time
writing the next day's story unless the
candidate provides a digital report.

Find a way to get lists of contributors
into your newspaper. Every time we
do it, we get story tips from people
who suddenly understand why they
got beat on that last contract awarded
by City Hall. Don't be shy about call-
ing people to find out why they do-
nate. Sometimes they'll be remark-
ably candid.

Be creative about campaign finance
stories and charts. Write about the
biggest donations from people out-
side the city or state, who won't be
able to vote for the candidate they're
sending money to. Write about the
people who are giving to three or four
candidates in the same campaign.
Pay attention to contributions from
out-of-state PACs - frequently they'll
be raising money under rules that are
different from those that prevail in
your own state; for instance, some
can take money from corporations.
When you write about various cam-
paign issues, include a box with rel-
evant campaign finance data - lists
of union contributions to go with a

Uplink

story on organized labor, for instance,
or lists of real estate and developer
contributions to go with a story on
suburban sprawl. Use a mapping pro-
gram to show which areas of your city
or state are making the heaviest po-
litical donations or how financial sup-
port for different candidates breaks
down geographically.

Pay attention to campaign expendi-
tures as well as contributions. Some
of your best stories may involve trans-
fers of money between different po-
litical organizations, or the use of
campaign funds for personal ex-
penses or other questionable pur-
poses. And don't forget about in-kind
contributions - frequently, they'll help
identify a candidate's fundraisers, a
particularly influential group.

Tech tips...
Looking for the perfect – fuzzy – match
By Ron Nixon, IRE and NICAR

Matching information from two
datasets is seldom an easy task,
especially if they lack a matching
pair of unique identifying fields. So
often we're forced to join tables on
several fields (name, address, date
of birth, etc.) to find matches. This,
however, does not find misspellings
and other problems created by poor
data entry.

Over the years various government
agencies, medical professionals
and genealogists have developed
several name-matching algorithms
that journalists can use. These
algorithms allow you to make
matches where the spelling is
slightly off, something that is hard
to do with traditional database joins.
They can also be used to check for
duplicates, even when the names
are off slightly, and searching a
database when you don't quite
know the spelling.

Soundex can help
One of the earliest matching
algorithms developed was the
Soundex function. It was developed
by the Census Bureau in the late
1800s to find names that sounded
alike phonetically. Soundex is a
built-in function in FoxPro, SQL
Server and many other software
packages, but not Access.

To add the function to Access, you
can download an Access 2000
database file that includes - in the
"Modules" section - the Visual Basic
for Applications scripts for Soundex
and more at www.nicar.org/
techtips.html.

Soundex gets rid of all the vowels
in a surname, assigns numbers to
the remaining letters and changes
it into an alphanumeric string. Using
these codes, reporters can match
names that are similar phonetically.
Take, for example, the Soundex
code for Nixon: N250.
This query in Access using SQL
would match all names that had the
same Soundex code:

Select a.name, b.name,
otherfield
From table a, table b
Where
Soundex (a.name) =Soundex (b.name)

Of course, you'll get some matches
that aren't really the same. Using a
database of surnames, I found that
there were 63 Soundex matches for
Nixon, many of which bore no
resemblance to Nixon. And
misspellings of the name might not
match since the code could be different.

name
Exprt
NiFon N250
Nickson N250
Nicols N242
Nickerson N262

Soundex has other weakness.
Since it is based on English
pronunciation, many European
names may not translate correctly
to a Soundex string. For example,
some French surnames will not
translate according to
pronunciation. Take the names
Beau and Beaux. Both are
pronounced the same, yet they
would have different Soundex
codes (B000 and B200,
respectively).

These limitations in Soundex led the
New York State Identification and
Intelligence System in 1970 to
create a new algorithm named after
the agency - NYSIIS. Many
intelligence agencies today
continue to use NYSIIS in one form
or another.

Downloading NYSIIS
NYSIIS is not native to FoxPro,
Access, SQL Server or any of the
other software products commonly
used by CAR mavens. There is
FoxPro code for the algorithm,
however, downloadable from
www.civilsolutions.com.au/
publications/dedup.htm. Place the
downloaded program in your
FoxPro default folder. An example
of testing NYSIIS:

NAXAN
NACSAN
Command
set procedure to nysiis
store "Nixon" to name
? nysiis(name)
store "Nickson" to name
? nysiis(neme)

NYSIIS works well with Spanish
and southern European names. It
supposedly has difficulty with
Japanese and French derivative
names.

Unlike Soundex, NYSIIS maintains
vowels, but changes them all to As.

Uplink

It also returns a purely alphabetic
code. So under NYSIIS, Nixon
becomes NAXAN. Whereas Nixon
and Nickson would have matched
under the Soundex algorithm, they
would be different under NYSIIS.
Nickson would be NACSAN. Using
a FoxPro SQL query to match the
names in two different databases
with NYSIIS:

Select a.name, b.name;
From table a, table b;
Where
NYSIIS (name)=NYSIIS(name)

This would give you matches, based
on stricter criteria than Soundex.
NYSIIS resulted in only four
phonetic matches for Nixon, with
only one bad match. No doubt you'll
miss some matches because of the
more strict rules in NYSIIS;
however, it will save you the trouble
of trying to weed through hundreds
of wrong matches.

Watching Metaphone
In 1990, Lawrence Phillips, a
computer programmer, sought to
improve on Soundex and created
Metaphone.

While similar to Soundex in many
ways - it strips out vowels -
Metaphone attempts to follow the
commonplace rules of English. As
an example, Soundex equates "g"
and "j" no matter how they are used
and also assigns "c," "q." "z" and "k"
to the same number.

Metaphone reduces the alphabet to
16 constant sounds and gives a
phoneticized spelling of a name.
Under Metaphone, Nixon becomes
NKSN and would match Nickson,
which would also have the same
code NKSN. Metaphone, because
of the way it is constructed, limits
matches more than Soundex.
Metaphone, used on the database
of surnames mentioned above,
found seven phonetic matches for
Nixon, with five being good
matches.

Matt Waite at the St. Petersburg
Times used the algorithm and
received good results, unlike when
he used Soundex and got hundreds
of wrong matches.

"I took 650,000 records from one
agency's check register, and 500
records from another licensing
agency and POOF! I get 5,127
matches, and they were good
matches. Misspellings, strange
spellings, abbreviations, they're all
there," he said.

Metaphone is included in the
Access database file mentioned
earlier, but is not part of other widely
used database manager programs.

Nicols NKL
Nickerson NKRSN

Phillips has since improved on the
Metaphone algorithm with a new
one called Double Metaphone,
which reduces the alphabet to 12
constant sounds, and gives an even
stricter match. Soundex, too, has
been improved. Soundex2 debuted
not long ago and corrects some of
the problems with the original
version.

CAMPAIGN FINANCE
Looking at campaign
expenditures
By Ted Sherman, The Star-Ledger

"Follow the Money" is the mantra of
campaign finance reporting.

Sometimes, though, the most interest-
ing trail is not who gave — but where
the money went.

The focus of campaign finance analy-
sis usually looks at how much special
interest groups are able to funnel into
any given election. Each year, we build
databases for statewide campaigns
such as the gubernatorial race, the
political action committees of the
state's legislative leadership, as well as
the U.S. Senate campaigns. The aim
is to document the bundling of contri-
butions from powerful law firms, devel-
opers, lobbyists and others looking to
parlay contribution limits into a much
louder voice.

How the campaigns actually spend the
money, though, is not always so care-
fully analyzed. Campaign finance re-
porters will look at total expenditures
and break down major spending —
such as media buys and consulting
expenses. The trouble is that expendi-
ture reports are not available as elec-
tronic records for Senate or statewide
campaigns, and it costs money to get
them inputted for database analysis.
It can be money well spent.

In this year's race for mayor in New-
ark, N.J. — a classic battle between
an entrenched political organization
and a well-financed, self-styled re-
former — an initial look at campaign
finance reports suggested the dis-
bursements would be fertile ground for
further examination.

The incumbent, Mayor Sharpe James,
had raised $1.3 million going into the
May campaign. Yet his expenditure
reports showed he had spent just about
all of it before even declaring he was a
candidate for office. Eyeballing the
paper records available from the state
Election Law Enforcement Commis-
sion raised other questions. With more
than a dozen reports and four years of
data to examine in the current election
cycle (more than 3,000 records over-
all), we opted to pay someone to type
it into a database.

Grouping the expenses
We use a simple technique to exam-
ine bundling and to group election data.
We create a separate column that
shows ties among contributors or ex-
penses. For example, we will carry over
the employer records to that column,
and then edit it to include spouses,
children, or related companies, so that
grouping shows the full extent of bun-
dling. For expenditures, we will clas-
sify payments into subcategories —
such as entertainment, fundraising,
salaries and consulting.

After getting all of James' contributions
and expenditures into an Access data-
base, we documented where the
mayor got his money — and it came
from those who work for him. Nearly

30 percent of the money to the mayor
came from 678 contributors on the
Newark city payroll – including clerks,
administrators and members of the
police and fire departments.

"Employees come because they want
to come," he said of his fund-raisers.
"They come because they do the Elec-
tric Slide. They come because they
know they're going to have fun, be-
cause I'm a fun person."

But those same reports revealed that
the mayor spared little expense on
those and other events. After cleaning
up and grouping that data, we found
he had spent $290,558 on catering
over the past four years, $73,015 on
entertainment, $8,241 on the design
and printing of invitations, and $7,280
on centerpieces. He spent $10,624 in
airfare from Los Angeles one year for
the entertainment for one birthday
fund-raiser.

The story basically showed how the
mayor had spent little on actual cam-
paign expenses, but instead utilized
the trappings of old-style, ward politics
— like Thanksgiving turkeys, summer
picnics, and city jobs – to solidify his
political base.

The first time we employed this kind of
intensive expenditure analysis was
during the 2000 campaign of Jon
Corzine, who spent more than $62 mil-
lion in his successful run for U.S. Sen-
ate in New Jersey. Again, the story was
prompted by the level of spending.

As in the case of Sharpe James, we
had every contribution — as well as
every expenditure - input into a data-
base, so that we could aggregate even
the seemingly smallest expenses.
There, we found that Corzine was not
only spending money (mostly his own)
on consultants and a media blitz, but
was spreading thousands of dollars in
contributions to local politicians, to
county committees, churches and eth-
nic groups. He donated $10,000 to the
Hunterdon County Democratic Com-
mittee-a county with just 8,916 Demo-
crats, where Republicans outnumber

money
continued from page 21
Democrats more than 2 to 1.

Corzine's campaign finance reports
revealed he contributed to a local poli-
tician who was not up for re-election,
but has a core constituency of Trenton
voters he needed to win. In the two
weeks before the election, our expen-
diture database was able to spell out
how Corzine spent more than $2.8 mil-
lion on canvassing, field organizing and
other get-out-the-vote activities.

Uncovering stealth giving
Expenditure reports can also be a
roadmap to stealth giving. Some
county committee reports we exam-
ined, for example, showed huge con-
tributions to other county committees.
Why would any county raise money
and give it to someone else's candi-
dates? We learned later it was a case
of conduit financing. Some vendors
don't want the powers-that-be in one
county to know they are giving to both
sides. So they give it to another county
committee, which later writes out the check.

Such reporting can lead to other ques-
tions as well. In one New Jersey city,
the mayor raised eyebrows after his
campaign disbursements showed he
had taken $25,000 from the coffers of
the city's Democratic organization to
contribute to the campaign for presi-
dent of the Dominican Republic.

In addition to helping pinpoint unusual
spending in a well-funded campaign
full of disbursements, analyzing expen-
diture reports by computer can also
map spending over the timeline of a
campaign, and allows the grouping of
hundreds of seemingly small pay-
ments, like salaries, postage and tele-
phone expenses.

Like so many CAR projects, though,
the biggest hurdle is getting the data.
To follow the money, you've got to be
able to count it.

pounding on police officers. Interest-
ingly, many of the critics mentioned
Sept. 11, as if to suggest that scrutiny
of law enforcement was no longer ap-
propriate after the World Trade Center
attacks.

The police department had already
started looking into other models for
civilian involvement, including the
creation of a disciplinary review board
that would include two non-police of-
ficers. That work continues. The Pub-
lic Safety Review Commission is re-
drafting its budget to request addi-
tional funding.

QSA
From the Lists

Listserv messages you may have missed
between members of NICAR-L, Census-L and
IREplus-L. To learn about joining these mailing
lists and searching their archives visit
www.ire.org/membership/listserv.html.

Per 100,000 calculation

Q. I have a total population of 8.9
million – of that population, 325
died from a certain cause. How can
I get that to reflect a per 1,000
deaths number so I can compare
it to a different population and a
different death count?

A. You probably want deaths per
100,000, not per 1,000. Divide 8.9
million by 100,000 which will give
you 89. Then divide 325 by 89,
which means 3.7 deaths per
100,000. If you did it by 1,000, the
answer would be 0.037 deaths per
1,000, which seems pretty mean-
ingless.

Results with Excel

Q. I'm trying to put together an
Excel worksheet that shows which
candidate carried each precinct.
The layout would be Precinct, Can-
didate, Candidate, Candidate,
Candidate, Winner with the winner
being determined by who gets the
most votes.

A. Try putting this formula in:
=INDEX(B$1:F$1,MATCH(MAX(B2:F2),
B2:F2,0)) presuming your headers
are on row 1, and you have a can-
didates in columns b through f, with
precinct results starting on row 2.
You'll probably want to do a count
on the occurrences of Max(b2:f2)
just to be sure there isn't a tie.

Paradox problem

Q. I'm trying to import some data
into Paradox 8.0. It's delimited text.
I get a "table is full" error that stops
the import. The table is only about
131 megabytes. Paradox is sup-
posed to have a two gigabyte up-
per limit. Any idea what the prob-
lem is?

A. This error message generally
appears when you have probably
hit the limit on the number of blocks
that a Paradox table can contain
(65,535 blocks). In order to store
additional records in the file, you'll
need to increase the table's block
size to allow each block to hold
more records. See http://
community.borland.com/article/
0,1410,10318,00.html

ArcView attributes

Q. If I want to show only some of
the attributes for my table, how can
I eliminate the ones I don't want
from the HTML Mapper output?

A. In your source view, go into
table properties and uncheck the
fields you want to disappear. They
won't appear in the output.

Changing names via FTP

Q. We got raw election returns via
FTP. The returns were sent incre-
mentally over the evening as
"results.asc" The problem is we
had to grab the file quickly and re-
name it lest the next file overwrite
the old file. Is there some kind of
script we could run to re-name
each file a unique name? We're
running FTP software by Ipswitch
on Windows 2000.

A. We used Magic File Renamer,
a cheap little piece of shareware,
to rename all the Census FTP files.

Uplink

It is slick and easy and it's $15.
Here's the site: http://
doodu.tripod.com/. If you are
using WS_FTP you can go into Op-
tions->Session (cont'd) and then
click the check box "Receive
Unique (PC assigns name)".

Select in SQL Server

Q. I use SQL Server for most of
my data analysis, and love it be-
cause it's quite a bit faster than
other programs I've used. How-
ever, one little thing really gets on
my nerves, and I'm hoping one of
you has a solution. When I'm work-
ing with data in diagram pane,
which is similar to Access' view of
tables and joins, I often use SE-
LECT INTO to create new tables
based on the joins in two or more
current tables. You can easily se-
lect the fields you want to use, but
every time you do, the SQL that is
generated includes an AS, like
such:

SELECT info9899$.ID AS
Exprl, info9899$.CYACTIVE
AS Expr2, etc, etc, etc.

This happens whether you choose
two fields with the same name or
not. It's a pain, because I've got to
edit out all of those "AS Expr" be-
fore I run the query. Anyone know
how to turn that off, or have a bet-
ter way to approach this type of
problem?

A. When a query is generated, by
default, it starts with "select *". Af-
ter a select all any field you select
will duplicate the name. Hence,
SQL inserts Expr1 etc. Solution:
Remove the asterisk. If you don't
have another field selected, SQL
will give you an error message. Tell
it to buzz off. Also, in the grid, if
you already have a series of Expr's
generated, simply click on the alias
column. All aliases will be high-
lighted, then hit the delete key.

conference
continued from page 1

Another special guest speaker, Mark
Monmonier, geography professor at
Syracuse University, spoke to dozens
of journalists about the best and worst
uses of mapping in the news.

And, on that Saturday night, IRE and
NICAR honored University of North
Carolina Professor Philip Meyer, one
of the guiding lights of computer-as-
sisted reporting with a special tribute,
recognizing his achievements in pro-
moting the use of social science
methods to uncover the news.

Many of the panels and discussions
recapped issues from the big stories
of the past year: terrorism and war,
the Florida election ballot count and
the 2000 Census. Presenters on
other panels explained how they used
data to cover beats (local govern-
ment, the statehouse, police) or drive
the big projects.

During the beginners' track sessions
on Thursday, panelists offered entry-
level CAR tips, everything from get-
ting started to grabbing data off the
Internet.

With so many panels and presenta-
tions, it's impossible to mention all the
great happenings at the annual con-
ference. Instead, in this issue of Up-
link, we're passing along a sampling
of tips from presenters.

John Byczkowski, of the Cincinnati
Enquirer, who was on the "Describ-
ing a Community's Economic Health"
panel, lists ways you can see if your
region is vibrant or sickly.

Bob Warner, of the Philadelphia Daily
News and moderator of the "Finding
Waste and Corruption in Local Gov-
ernment" panel, tells how you can
track campaign finance in city hall.

Tom Torok of The New York Times ex-
plains how he created a special
intranet (internal network using Web
tools) after Sept. 11 so editors and
reporters at his newspaper could
manage the crush of information com-
ing in from around the globe.

And Paul Overberg of USA Today,
from his presentation on the panel
"Mining Census for Non-Census Sto-
ries," tells how to make plans to use
the next wave of census data.

If you missed the Philadelphia CAR
conference, take heart: You can al-
ways attend the 2003 conference in
Charlotte, N.C.

Highlighting polygons

Q. I'm using ArcView and have a
parcel map shapefile that's poly-
gons, but I can't highlight a poly-
gon I've selected - with either the
pointer tool or the select features
tool. It does turn the record in the
attribute table yellow but not the
polygon on the view.

A. If you go into legend editor
and fill the polygons with some
color, they will display as yellow
when selected.

Splitting columns

Q. I have a worksheet with 24,000
rows and one column. I want to
split the one column into three col-
umns and separate the data by
semi-colons - where is that func-
tion?

Here's what I have One column
that reads: John Doe; 10 Short
Street; Lafayette, La. 70506

I want to make that three columns
that read:
John Doe
10 Short Street
Lafayette, La. 70506

A. Highlight the column contain-
ing the information and go to Data,
Text to Columns. Choose "delim-
ited" and put in the semi-colon as
the delimiter.

Cleaning up spreadsheets

Q. I've got an Excel spreadsheet
that thinks it's bigger than it really
is. There are about 400 rows of
data, but the sheet thinks it has
65,000. This makes saving, copy-
ing and everything else take a long
time. I know Access has a "repair
and compact" function for data-
bases. Is there something similar
for Excel?

A. Go to cell A401 (assuming
that's the first blank below your
data), then hold down the Shift key,
hit the End key, and then the Down
arrow. That should select all the
rows. Then delete the selected,
empty rows.
