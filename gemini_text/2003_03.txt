DATA ACCESS
Obtaining
restricted
files
By Megan Christensen
IRE & NICAR

You think you have found the
perfect data: thorough, current,
topical, ASCII text. Then, the
fine print. "This data is provided
for statistical research purposes
only" or "Authorized for release
to qualified research personnel
or institutions."

The good news is that there is
no special data club only for
people with Ph.Ds. Journalists,
too, can sign research agree-
ments and gain access to da-
tabases. These arrangements
can open the door to a wide
variety of data for computer-as-
sisted reporting.

But before accepting data with
legal strings attached, journal-
ists who've considered these
agreements recommend ex-
ploring: Is there any other way
to get the story? Can I report
the story the way I want under
the terms of the agreement?

Agencies restrict access to
many of these data sets be-

SPOTLIGHT: CAR FOR WARTIME
Key data, resources
for covering conflict
By Brant Houston, IRE & NICAR

Databases and resources abound for
covering war-related stories, but orga-
nizing them in a useful way can be a
challenge. At IRE's recent Annual Com-
puter-Assisted Reporting Conference in
Charlotte, several speakers slotted the
resources into these categories.

Military and security
• The U.S. Census Bureau has an enor-
mous amount of data on the military,
veterans, educational background of
military and so on. Summary File 3 of
the Census 2000 release is jam-
packed with information. You can use
American Factfinder (http://factfinder.
census.gov) to zero in on what you need.

• National Guard and reserves deploy-
ment data can be obtained from the
Defense Department DefenseLink Web
site in Adobe Acrobat format at
www.defenselink.mil/news/Apr2003/
d20030409ngr.pdf. Check the
DefenseLink news releases section
for updated lists.

• Defense contract data is in the Fed-
eral Procurement Database or on the
Web at www.defenselink.mil/news/
contracts.html. The DefenseLink Web
site also has reports with html tables on
a variety of subjects. The IRE and NICAR
Database Library can provide the pro-
curement database to journalists.

The U.S.-led war with Iraq is over but
key questions remain unanswered.
How long will coalition forces remain
in the country? Will troops continue to
battle pockets of resistance? Who will
profit from rebuilding Iraq? No one has
the answers, but you can count on IRE

New audit data
How are government agencies
and nonprofit groups spending
money they received from
Uncle Sam? A new database
from the IRE and NICAR Da-
tabase Library can help jour-
nalists find out. The Federal
Audit Clearinghouse database
lists all audits of state and lo-
cal governments, and
nonprofits that spent $300,000
or more a year in federal
money. The database contains
audits from 1997, when the
federal government started re-
quiring them, through Febru-
ary 2003. There are 170,900
records in all.

Unlike other databases avail-
able from the Database Li-
brary namely, the Consoli-
dated Federal Funds Report
(CFFR) and the Federal Assis-
tance Award Data System
(FAADS) - the Federal Audit
database looks at the spend-
ing of federal assistance. It
also includes audits of sub-re-
cipients of federal aid. So if a
state government gives some
of its federal award money to
local agencies, audits of those
local agencies will also appear
in the database.

The data contains information
about whether the audits have
revealed any problems, plus
valuable contact information,
including names, addresses
and phone numbers for the au-
dited organizations and the au-
ditors. To order the database,
call the Database Library at

SPOTLIGHT: CAR FOR WARTIME
Tracking deportations
by country of origin
By Mark Bixler, Atlanta Journal-Constitution

Not long ago, computer-assisted re-
porting was a language that other re-
porters spoke, as foreign to me as
Serbo-Croatian. I had a hard enough
time opening e-mail attachments, so
slicing and dicing numbers by com-
puter seemed beyond my grasp. Then
my newspaper sent me to a four-day
workshop that it sponsored with the
National Institute for Computer-As-
sisted Reporting. An instructor
demystified spreadsheets and data-
bases. I saw the possibilities.

I cover immigrants and immigration
for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution
and have written extensively about
changes affecting non-citizens since
✓ Sept. 11, 2001. The Immigration and
Naturalization Service detained hun-
dreds of people from Arab and Mus-
lim nations for violations of immigra-
tion law that were once considered
minor, such as overstaying a visa. It
has held many of them in secret and
displayed great reluctance to divulge
information about them.

Wouldn't it be great, I thought, to
know the nationality of people de-
ported after Sept. 11?

A simple phone call to the INS public
affairs office in Washington got a
Microsoft Excel spreadsheet in my e-
mail inbox that showed the national-
ity of all people removed from the
United States for the past six budget
years. It listed countries alphabetically;
the nations were not ranked by the
number deported in any particular year.

The spreadsheet had more than 200
rows for the countries, from Afghani-
stan to Zimbabwe. The 18 columns
showed for each of the past six years
the number of people expelled, the
number of criminal expulsions and the
number of noncriminal expulsions.

Lucky for me, the federal budget year
runs from Oct. 1 through Sept. 30. The
most recent figures were for the 2002
budget year, which corresponded
closely to the 12 months after Sept.
11, 2001. Any changes from previous
years would be easy to spot.

My knowledge of immigration law
came in handy. I knew people are
deported for two main reasons. They
either commit a crime, such as break-

ing into a house or selling drugs, or
they violate immigration law by enter-
ing the country without permission or
overstaying a visa.

Slicing the data
To determine whether - and to what
degree - the INS had shifted its fo-
cus, I decided to analyze all the ex-
pulsion categories. The last category,
expulsions for immigration law viola-
tions, was important. There are 2,000

INS agents and about 8 million ille-
gal immigrants in the U.S., so the
agency has great discretion in how it
uses its limited resources.

Armed with my new, elementary
spreadsheet skills, I ranked all coun-
tries by the percentage change in citi-
zens deported from the previous year.
I calculated percentage change in de-
portations from year to year and then
used the Excel sort function to put
them in descending order. The coun-
tries with the largest increases of citi-
zens deported appeared at the top of
my table. What I found would make
its way into the paper soon enough:

The number of foreign nationals ex-
pelled to North Africa, the Middle East

of the 10 countries with the most dra-
matic increases in deportation were

ria (111 percent). By contrast, over-

Tracking

ported to Mexico, which sends the
vast majority of immigrants to the
United States, went down 24 percent.

Further spreadsheet calculations put
my findings in context.

In previous years, none of the Mus-
lim nations ranked among the top
countries in surges in citizens de-
ported. Those nations that did have
the biggest increases, from Armenia
in 1998 to Bolivia in 2001, had more
modest jumps than did many of the
Muslim countries in the year after
Sept. 11. The number of Bolivians
deported from October 2000 through
September 2001, for example, in-
creased 170 percent, more than for
any other country with at least 10 citi-
zens deported the previous year. Four
countries (Yemen, Egypt, Morocco
and Tunisia) had more dramatic in-
creases in the following year.

The changes were even more dra-
matic in the deportation of what the
INS calls "non-criminal immigrants" -
people who were kicked out the coun-
try for overstaying a visa of some
other violation of U.S. immigration
laws. The top eight were Muslim na-
tions: Morocco (407 percent), Tunisia,
Yemen, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan,
Algeria and Egypt (166 percent).
Meanwhile, the number of Mexican
nationals deported for immigration
offenses, such as overstaying a visa,
went down 38 percent. The total num-
ber of "non-criminal immigrants" who
were removed declined 28 percent.

Calculate, sort
I arrived at all of these findings with
basic spreadsheet methods: Write a
formula to calculate the percentage
change, then sort descending.

Stepping up the focus on illegal im-
migrants from Muslim nations struck
many as common sense given that all
19 hijackers who struck on Sept. 11,
2001, were from Muslim nations (only
two had overstayed their visa and
were eligible for deportation at the
time of the attacks). Others raised
questions about racial profiling and
selective enforcement: Why throw a
Pakistani in jail for overstaying a visa
while a Mexican who did the same
thing goes free?

Doris Meissner, INS commissioner
from 1993 to 2000, told me that in-
creased scrutiny of foreign nationals
from Muslim nations "was inevitable
and predictable right after 9-11, but I
think it became clear pretty quickly
that focusing that way was not un-
earthing terrorists."

The authorities have charged at least
13 U.S. citizens with crimes relating
to terrorism. None of the roughly 900
non-citizens held for immigration vio-
lations after the terrorists attacks has
been charged as a terrorist.

My story pointed out that the
deportees included an Arab student
in New York who was expelled for
-working seven hours a week beyond
what his visa allowed and a Jorda-
nian in New Jersey who violated
terms of a tourist visa by working at
a Dunkin' Donuts; evidence, immigrant
advocates say, that the focus on Arab
and Muslim immigrants has ensnared
petty violators, not hard-core terrorists.

I also interviewed people such as
Carma Said of Bethlehem, Pa. She
said the INS deported her husband
to Egypt even though it had approved
his request for legal residency.

My first computer analysis came with
a mini-crisis or two. I forgot a formula
one day and couldn't remember how
to sort columns the next. More com-
puter-savvy reporters in the office an-
swered my questions about columns
and rows and sorts and filters. Those
terms might sound foreign to the un-
initiated, but spend a few hours with
someone who knows and you'll discover
what I did: It's not that hard after all.

FEDERAL SPENDING
Getting a handle
on shuttle contractors
By Jeff Porter, IRE and NICAR

Space shuttle Columbia crashed in
pieces Feb. 1, and all the NASA shuttle
program money going to contractors
quickly became part of the story.

Journalists covering that angle of the
story found that a database of federal
contracts of $25,000 or more called
the Federal Procurement Data System
is a great source of information for
looking at program spending.

The IRE and NICAR Database Li-
brary maintains copies of the data
from the General Services Adminis-
tration back to 1992, covering about
a half-million federal contracts each
fiscal year. The day of the shuttle di-
saster, the Database Library culled all
of the NASA contracts for each of
those years, then posted the data and
documentation on its FTP server for
a quick download.

Two dozen news organizations ob-
tained the data. In some instances, it
allowed journalists to show a local
connection to the space program, be-
cause the data could show exactly
how much money NASA gave to spe-
cific contractors in a given state, city
or county.

The database is fairly straightforward
with a few wrinkles.

There's just one data table, although
IRE and NICAR provide a few lookup
tables with geographic information
and details about the contractors. The
primary data table includes the
agency, name and address of the
company, the amount of the contract,
the type of work and where the work
was performed.

The type of work listed is not specific
enough for certain news reporting.
For example, it doesn't say the com-

pany worked on the left wing of the
space shuttle Columbia. Instead, it
might say the company's product or
service involved "space vehicles" or
"space vehicle components."

Next, contracts can be modified over
time, and it's important to understand
how the changes are reflected in the
data. The GSA data system has a
separate record for each of these
modifications with each record bear-
ing the same contract number. Take,
for instance, contract NAS850000
(with the Boeing Co. for space ve-
hicles), modified 104 times from fis-
cal year 1992 through 2001.

The records show modification No
135 in 2001 and an additional obliga-
tion of $16.7 million. The next modifi-
cation resulted in a reduction of the
obligation by $1.2 million. So if you
add all the numbers together (some-
times over several fiscal years), you
can find the total.

Complicating matters further, the
GSA has added some fields over
time. For fiscal year 2001, the IRE and
NICAR Database Library created a
program that processes the data,
which will smooth some consistency
with field names and how dollar
amounts are handled over the long
run. All those are reflected in the
documentation the Database Library
provides. Those documents should
be examined carefully to account for
any of those changes.

It's possible to turn the 10 yearly data
files into one. The Database Library
kept them separate so it could deliver
the data more quickly to journalists
the day of the shuttle disaster.

Now, let's turn to the data. We'll go
over a basic series of Visual FoxPro

Uplink

commands to choose the fields we're
interested in and string the years to-
gether, then make some basic que-
ries of the data. Any number of other
database managers - Access, SQL
Server, for example-could do the trick, too.

First, we studied the documentation
and, for our purposes, decided to go
with 18 fields, chosen because of
their consistency year to year and
their importance. They include the
contracting agency, the number iden-
tifying the contract and any modifica-
tion, the amount of money, the four
fields describing the type of work, the
three different fields that could list the
company name, plus the locating in-
formation on where the company is
based and where the work was per-
formed. (See the record layout at
www.ire.org/datalibrary/databases/
fedcontacts/layout.txt).

can be found at www.nicar.org/

parts of the program.

We continued to make separate
tables of each year. If a field was
named differently in a previous year,
we told the program to change the
name, simply like this:

... siccd naicscd,;
sicnomen naics,;...

The GSA had changed its reference
from the SIC (Standard Industrial
Classification) to NAICS (North
American Industry Classification Sys-
tem) from one year to the next. The
language simply tells Fox to select the
fields refer to SIC and call them the
same field names as the 2001 data
calls them.

Before 2001, the data implies three
zeroes after the dollar amount. So to
make it consistent, we multiplied all the
dollar amount fields by 1,000 like this:

...dollars*1000 dollaramt,;...

That line simply does the math and
names the field the same as the 2001
data. The 1999 data had a slight varia-
tion for the dollar amounts. Instead of
indicating a negative number, the data
included a field, called NEGATIVE,
showing whether the number is nega-

tive or positive. So for the 1999 data
file, before we ran our main program
(although we could have incorporated
it into that program), we created a new
dollar amount field, then ran a couple
of replacements:

Replace all dollar2 with dollar
Replace all dollar2 with 0-dollar for
negative = '-'

Before we stitched all those years to-
gether, we needed a way to tell which
year is which, so we added a field to
each table and told Fox to fill that in
with the appropriate year:

use nasa98
alter table nasa98;
add column year c(4)
replace all year with '1998′
close databases

Finally, we reopened the 2001 table
we simply called NASA, then ap-
pended all the years together.

There are other ways around this. For
-example, one could have added the
years, then run a UNION ALL query
to string the tables together.

With the data file covering 1992-2001,
containing 114,126 records, a few
queries could trigger some potential
thoughts. Here's a very simple one:

select year, sum(dollaramt)
total;
from nasa;
where prodcd like '18%';
group by 1;
order by 1

It shows a 10-year timeline of the
money related to space vehicles. In-
terested in a particular state?

select year,
total;
from nasa;
sum(dollaramt)
where prodcd like '18%′ and
(contsted = 'TX' or stateperf
=
'TX');
group by 1;
order by 1

That includes the same timeline, but

limiting it to contracts where the com-
pany is located in Texas or the work
was performed in Texas. Locate the
biggest contractors for Texas, on
space vehicles work?

select contestcd, contnmicar,
contnmcif1, sum(dollaramt)
total;
from nasa;
where prodcd like '18%′ and
(contstcd = 'TX' or stateperf
=
'TX');
group by 1;
order by 4 desc

This query groups by the Dun and
Bradstreet number for the company,
the field called CONTESTCD. That's
often useful because the data is
somewhat inconsistent in how the
company is named. It's important to
note, though, that some companies
have multiple Dun and Bradstreet
numbers, so you might need to do a
little data checking and cleaning for
accuracy and consistency.

Nancy Amons of WSMV-Nashville,
was able to localize the shuttle disas-
ter with federal contract data from IRE
and NICAR, reporting "NASA pumps
millions into our local economy," iden-
tifying companies and finding people
to interview, guided by the data.

"In all," Amons reported, "NASA
awarded nearly $21 million in con-
tracts to Tennessee companies in
2001. Saturday's disaster could mean
even more."

The latest uses of mapping
in news reporting.

The
Business
of War
By Ron Nixon, IRE and NICAR

Wars and ethnic conflicts have
wreaked havoc on the economies
and internal stability of develop-
ing countries around the world.
Many of these are countries in
name only, as the strife has frac-
tured them into sections. For a
small number of people around
the world, however, wars and
conflicts have been profitable.

Many operate out of places and
countries that few Americans
have ever heard of, so when the
Center for Public Integrity's Inter-
national Consortium of Investiga-
tive Journalists began its special
report called "Making a Killing:
The Business of War," it used

ArcView 3.2 to create
maps that illustrated
the global connec-
tions of the weapons
trade.

The center used
ArcView to show
places like Ostend,
Belgium, an operating
base of key weapons
dealer Victor Bout. It
also used the map-
ping software to show
the location of the oil-rich Gulf of
Guinea, where several states
employ private military compa-
nies (once called mercenaries)
and the location of the rich dia-
mond deposits in the Congo.

The maps were largely locator
maps and none required much
advanced GIS work, but they did
require research to locate infor-
mation. The mapping work con-
sisted of overlaying country
shapefiles, national capitals and
resource features from ArcAtlas:
Our Earth, an ESRI data set.
ArcAtlas lacked some of the re-
sources that the Center wanted
to show. For example, the loca-
tion of oil fields in most cases was
included, but not for those off-
shore. Additionally, resources
such as uranium tailings in
Angola were not included in the
shapefiles.

To get the loca-
tions of other re-
sources, the Cen-
ter turned to other
sources. One was
the CIA World
Factbook
(www.cia.gov/cia/
publications/
factbook/), with
maps and infor-
mation about ev-
ery country.

Google searches found the
Internet sites of global oil com-
panies and information about
their offshore sites.

Searches of the French news-
paper Le Monde were used to
locate some of the natural re-
sources, such as diamond
mines and oil fields. The Center
used the National Geographic
Web site, located
www.nationalgeographic.com,
to find many of the cities not in-
cluded in the ArcView shapefile
of major world cities.

The Center used the ArcView
legend editor and symbol palette
to create unique symbols for the
oil fields and diamond mines. The
Center also changed the back-
ground color of the view from the
default of none to blue, so the
oceans appeared as blue.

Though the maps were a small
part of the project, they helped
by showing the locations of the
places and key natural resources
discussed in the project.

FIRST VENTURE
Simple queries find
prince of the city
By Michael Lafleur, The (Lowell, Mass.) Sun

I had always thought that the most dif-
ficult part of any computer-assisted
reporting project would be negotiating
for the data.

But in my first real attempt at a CAR
story, I found the opposite to be true. I
got the data - a catalog of complaints
about alleged building and health code
violations at properties in the city of
Lowell - after a fight, but not an intol-
erable one. The most difficult part of
my project was figuring out what to do
with the data.

My initial story idea turned out to be
undoable with my time and budget
constraints, forcing me to explore other
avenues with the data. What began as
an attempt to examine the effective-
ness of Lowell's property inspection
system ended up as a profile of an
outspoken and flashy Nigerian prince
who was one of the largest owners of
run-down properties in the city.

The project started in late summer,
after several gang-related shootings in
one of the city's poorest neighbor-
hoods. Politicians in Lowell, a former
textile manufacturing boomtown,
called for a police crackdown on the
gangs. City administrators began fo-
cusing on the absentee landlords
whose properties police said served
as hangouts for the gangs.

With the new emphasis on enforcing
state building and health codes, we
wanted to quantify what had been
done prior to the high-profile crack-
down. We especially were interested
in determining the frequency of prop-
erty inspections and the city's overall
success rate for abating problem prop-
erties. I had attended a NICAR Boot
Camp a few months earlier and thought
this project presented a good opportunity
for me to incorporate what I had learned.

As I reported, I discovered that city
building inspectors kept a Microsoft Ac-
cess database of their activities dating
back to 1998. I asked for it, making what
seemed to be the first request for elec-
tronic records that the city of Lowell
ever had. My interest in the data ini-
tially triggered consternation from city
officials. The building commissioner
accused me of targeting him for unfair
scrutiny and said I would have to pay
50 cents a record for each of the 12,000
records in the database. City legal staff
asked me to place stricter limits on my
request. At the time, I wasn't exactly
sure what the data would show, but I
hoped that it would at least shed light
on the effectiveness of building depart-
ment inspections. Unfortunately, that
did not turn out to be the case.

The database contained complaints
about problem properties called into
the building department and a descrip-
tion of the response to them, but I was
told it was not comprehensive. I was
beginning to get a bit discouraged. I
soon learned that building inspectors
enforce only state building codes,
which encompass construction guide-
lines and minimum structural sound-
ness rules. They become involved with
properties when there are problems
such as a lack of exits from an apart-
ment or a balcony railing is unsafe.
Cockroach and rodent infestations, bro-
ken plumbing, leaking sewage, heat
and electricity shutoffs - almost any
problem in the interior of an apartment
are health code violations. These
account for the bulk of citations gener-
ated by the city and are handled by
Lowell's Health Department.

Health and building inspectors kept
records separately on paper, under a
property's address, and neither did it
very well. The state housing court for
my region lists all the Lowell property

citations that are heard by a judge, but
court records only are available on pa-
per at 50 cents a page and offer no in-
sight on how many complaints city in-
spectors actually resolve. Reporting a
story on the total number of inspections
conducted in Lowell and their outcome
would have required me to sift through
large numbers of files and far exceeded
the time I had available for the project
and possibly my newspaper's budget.

I discovered many of these shortcom-
ings about the same time I negotiated
my public records request with the city
legal staff. From the outset, the legal
staff repeatedly asked me to explain
specifically what I was looking for and
to limit my request to just that. My in-
sistence upon receiving all of the data
really flustered the city attorney I dealt
with. She was unfamiliar with the con-
cept of a database and seemed very
nervous about giving me something
that could reflect badly upon her later.
At one point, she said she would need
months to review every bit of informa-
tion in the database before she could
release it to me. But we finally sched-
uled a formal meeting.

She brought along the city's chief in-
formation officer, who reinforced her
demand that I explain exactly what I
wanted by unleashing a stream of
techno-jargon at me about how difficult
it could be to fulfill my request. This was
all very frustrating. It was now nearly
two months after I had asked for the
data and no one whom I was dealing
with had even looked at it. Had I been
unaware that the database was rela-
tively simple and small, the protests
would have sounded completely valid.

Luckily, the paper's executive editor,
Kevin G. Keene, had agreed to ac-
company me to the meeting. His will-
ingness to stand behind my request,
I think, was the deciding factor in my
success. He asked the two city offi-
cials to look at the database and re-
port back to us on how difficult it
would be to provide a copy. Other-
wise, he told them, we were willing to
pursue legal action. They agreed and
two weeks later I had a copy on com-

pact disc for $20. The chief informa-
tion officer, on instructions from the
attorney, redacted only the names of
people who filed complaints. She ar-
gued that releasing the complainants'
names would violate their privacy
rights under state law. I didn't chal-
lenge that because I was more inter-
ested in the number and focus of the
complaints than who complained.
(The public records attorney in the
Massachusetts Secretary of State's
office later told me he would have
sided with the attorney's interpreta-
tion if I had appealed.)

The NICAR-L listserv proved to be in-
valuable during the negotiations. I was
able to solicit the advice of veteran re-
porters who had already gone through
what I was experiencing. Every time I
dealt with the city attorney I asked jour-
nalists on the list about how to respond.
I also relied upon the free legal defense
hotline maintained by The Reporters
Committee for Freedom of the Press
(www.rcfp.org), which was another
very handy resource.

Unfortunately, my suspicions about
the shortcomings in the data proved
true. The database held two main
tables, a listing of building permits
granted and the catalog of property
complaints each containing be-
tween 10,000 and 15,000 records
dating to 1998. And then there were
three smaller tables that referred to
fields in one of the two larger tables.
But there would be no way for me to
quantify the efficiency of all city prop-
erty inspections. While I could have
done a story on how well building in-
spectors were addressing the com-
plaints they received, I would not be
able to provide a similar comprehen-
sive look at health inspectors, who field
many more property complaints.

Now the pressure was on. My boss
had invested money for me to attend
the Boot Camp and his time in help-
ing me get the data. Figuring out what
to do once I realized my initial idea
would not work was probably the most
intimidating part of my first experi-
ence with CAR.

Sifting through the data I came across
several complaints logged against a
man named Prince Charles Eweka,
who piqued my interest. It turned out
the prince had a fascinating story. The
scion of a Nigerian royal family, Eweka
was one of the largest property own-
ers in Lowell's low-income neighbor-
hoods. He insisted that he was trying
to reinvigorate the area, but the
prince's properties had myriad struc-
tural problems and a long history of
building and health code violations,
which he typically did not correct until
receiving a court order. But I found all
this through interviews and manually
reviewing city and court records.

My data analysis was very simple, and
Boot Camp had prepared me well for
what I needed to know. Using
Microsoft Access 97, I focused my at-
tention on the complaint table. I per-
formed a group by name and count
query to see which names appeared
most often. I didn't have time to thor-
oughly clean the data, but because the
table had relatively few records I
printed it and eyeballed it, looking for
alternate spellings that had escaped
my initial query. I corrected only the
names of people who appeared several
times. In that way, I came across Eweka
and decided to investigate him further.

The story, "The Prince vs. the City," ran
in December 2002 and detailed the
city's complaints against Eweka.

Looking back, I think my nervousness
about developing a story from the data
was just first-time jitters. Now that I've
incorporated CAR into a story once,
I'm much more comfortable with do-
ing it again. Next time, I won't be so
surprised if my initial preconceptions
aren't borne out by the data. Though I
have yet to figure out a way to quan-
tify the efficiency of Lowell's inspec-
tion departments, I still haven't ex-
hausted all the story possibilities for
the complaint database, and I'm cur-
rently using it in another project that
involves more data analysis.

EDUCATION
Analysis helps uncover
college funding scheme
By Natalya Shulyakovskaya, The Orange County Register

Our "Phantom Classes" series started
with a tip from a parent: His two sons
had received community college cred-
its for playing baseball in high school.
Their college transcripts from Cypress
College showed they had gotten A's -
even though they had to transfer to
another high school and did not even
complete the course.

By the time I joined the project in late
August 2002, my colleagues Scott Reid
and Marla Jo Fisher had already found
that Orange County community col-
leges enrolled high school athletes in
droves in what they called college
physical education courses. Their high
school coaches rounded them up for
the classes and got paid to run the
phantom college courses. These
classes, called Bridge P.E., are a varia-
tion of the legitimate "Bridge Program"
that allows qualified high school stu-
dents to "bridge” gaps in their educa-
tional programs by taking tougher com-
munity college classes that meet their
educational needs.

After I joined the project, we turned to
data analysis to get a clear picture of
the extent of the program. In early Sep-
tember, we requested enrollment,
course, student and faculty data from
the California Community Colleges
Chancellor's Office, using the Califor-
nia Public Records Law.

It took two months of negotiations
e-mails, letters and even appeals to
state legislators until we received
some of the data we needed.

The Chancellor's Office argued that it
could not release student-level data
because the federal Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act prohibits the
release of easily identifiable student
records. Citing the same law, it argued
that it could not strip all the identifiable

information and replace the unique
identification numbers that link the stu-
dent and course tables. We accepted
course-level summary data under protest.

The data came from the Chancellor's
Office Management Information Sys-
tem (MIS), which gathers information
from California's 108 community col-
leges. We were not charged for the
data, which the office provided as
ASCII fixed format files and allowed us
to download from its Web site.

Tracking enrollment
The data covered 10 academic years
starting from 1992-93 and contained
records for 1.5 million courses, listing
the number of students, the number of
high school students and the number
of full-time equivalent students, or
FTEs, each course generated. The
colleges use FTEs to track their
workload and apply for funding.

The Register also obtained three ad-
ditional tables from the MIS office.
The tables listed more details for each
course, including whether the
courses were offered for credit. The
state allocates a much larger chunk
of funding based on the number of
for-credit FTEs. In fact, more than 80
percent of taxpayer funding is allo-
cated to community colleges on the
basis of for-credit FTEs, and we fo-
cused our analysis on those.

Oddly, some of the totals the colleges
reported for budget apportionment pur-
poses were different from the numbers
they had submitted for the MIS data-
base. It took some tests, conversations
with colleges and college finance ex-
perts to figure out how to handle the
discrepancies - especially since the
numbers fluctuated both ways.

Our analysis of the data showed that

while the entire community college
enrollment grew by 20 percent in the
last 10 years, growth in the physical
education classes outpaced most other
courses, increasing seven-fold. Since
the 1992-93 academic year, it bal-
looned from a mere 0.3 percent of the
entire California community college
system's enrollment to almost 2 percent.

Calculating costs
In order to figure out how much the
phantom P.E. courses were worth, we
waded though the state apportionment
reports and built a database detailing
funding allocations for each community
college district and for the state, based
on enrollment. The apportionment cal-
culations are used to distribute money
to community college districts. They are
based on numbers the districts report
to the state.

Five years worth of apportionment re-
ports, in Adobe Acrobat format, was
available on the Chancellor's Office
Web site. Each contained at least 72
pages densely covered with numbers
and text.

When I asked for the 10 years of the
data in tables, I was told it would take
about 12 weeks to compile. I saved the
data in the Acrobat files as text. It then
took me a day to write, test and modify
a FoxPro program that parsed each
report into a database.

Most of the muscle work, including re-
building and condensing the tables,
was done in Microsoft SQL Server.
SPSS came in handy for the final analysis.

To understand the community college
financing, I retraced steps used for cal-
culating apportionment funding. I used
three main sources for understanding
how the complicated funding formulas
worked: materials the Chancellor's Of-
fice provided to the college adminis-
trators during its annual statewide bud-
get information workshops; Title V
regulations that outlined funding algo-
rithms, and spreadsheets used by the
colleges to estimate their funding.

When my results came within 0.009

percent of the state's own numbers, I
felt confident enough to start estimat-
ing the worth of different courses to
community colleges.

Our most conservative analysis
showed that in the 2001-02 academic
year, high school athletes counted as
community college students generated
at least $56 million for the colleges.
Our reporting showed that in their
quest for higher enrollment and, ulti-
mately, more taxpayer dollars, the
colleges broke the rules defining what
could be called a college course. The
Bridge P.E. classes amounted to
nothing more than regular high school
sports practices. Some classes were
not held at all. Colleges paid millions
to high-school coaches to sign up and
train the enrolled high school kids.

Doing the math
Here is how I calculated the key num-
bers:

• $56 million received for Bridge P.E.
classes

Using the MIS database, I calculated
a percentage of total credit FTEs that
the colleges reported based on their
Bridge P.E. enrollment. For example, in
2001-02, Bridge P.E. accounted for 1.8
percent of all for-credit FTEs. That year
the state distributed $3.3 billion based
on for-credit FTEs.

Because of budget growth limits estab-
lished by the state, the state funded
only 96 percent of all for-credit enroll-
ments at community colleges in 2001-
02. So we adjusted the final worth of
Bridge P.E. to reflect that.

Some administrators argued that be-
cause Bridge P.E. represents roughly
2 percent of the entire enrollment these
sports classes essentially are run at no
cost to taxpayers. They base their ar-
gument on the fact that the funding
shortfall is 4 percent. But the state
doesn't calculate funding this way,
records and interviews show. In reality,
colleges apply for funding based on their
total enrollment - including Bridge P.E.
• At least 77 of the 108 California com-

munity colleges conducted Bridge P.E.
classes at high schools in spring 2002.

I counted only the colleges that had
more than 100 high school athletes
enrolled.

To come up with the most conserva-
tive estimate, The Register adjusted
the numbers of students counted by
the Chancellor's Office downward to
reflect differences between those
numbers and the numbers the col-
leges themselves report to the
Chancellor's Office fiscal unit.

For some colleges, counts in the MIS
data were lower than those reported
to the fiscal unit. For others, they were
higher. The Register adjusted down the
numbers for over-reporting colleges.
The adjustment was done only to ana-
lyze district-level data.

Statewide data was not adjusted be-
cause the state does not adjust its data.
The Register also ran tests to make
sure the differences between the two
different state databases did not affect
the overall trends.

• Typical P.E. class

The Register calculated the median
for the 2001-02 Bridge P.E. courses:
166 high school students.

• Percent of state-funded growth for
community colleges

The Register used the state budget
apportionment data to calculate
funded growth. Then the growth in
Bridge P.E. was calculated using the
MIS data. Because enrollment has
not been funded fully, growth in
Bridge P.E. was adjusted accordingly.
Then I calculated percentages.

As a result of our questions and sto-
ries, the state announced it was with-
holding $80 million from the commu-
nity colleges this year. The Chancellor's
Office and the state Department of Fi-
nance announced they were going to
conduct a system-wide audit. Califor-
nia legislators have called for an inde-

Uplink

pendent audit. Some colleges have
canceled their planned P.E. classes for
high school students. Our phones and
mailboxes were flooded by messages
from outraged readers and parents.
The stories especially in the midst
of the California budget crisis - have
really touched a nerve.

The IRE Resource Center has
copies of education stories using
computer-assisted reporting. Here
are some from 2002.

Story No. 19715: "An uneven
hand." The Seattle Post-
Intelligencer examined the
discipline gap in Seattle Public
Schools, where black students
were far more likely to be
suspended or expelled than
students of other races.

Story No. 19810: "A promise
broken: Failing Indiana's
schoolchildren." In two special
sections, The Indianapolis Star
examined school financing and
found that Indiana has repeatedly
asked schools to do more with
diminished resources. State
officials have failed teachers and
students by denying them time,
training and money to meet higher
standards; failed taxpayers by not
determining the costs to raise
student achievement.

Tech tip...
Using Census files to link 1990 and 2000 geography
By Dan Keating, The Washington Post

No one inconvenience can be
dubbed the bane of a Census
reporter's existence since there is
a whole list of banes, from shifting
release schedules to questionnaire
wording changes to margins of er-
ror. One nominee for the worst, how-
ever, is the shifts in Census geog-
raphy that can make calculating
changes over time a challenge. I
once naively thought that tracts ei-
ther split or combined. Oh, if it were
only true. They shift, re-combine in
parts and otherwise heave to and
fro like a sailboat tossed at sea.

Census reporters have tried various
approaches for reconciling the mov-
ing tracts. Richard O'Reilly at the
Los Angeles Times devised a bril-
liant approach in SAS that read the
raw text of the TIGER\Line mapping
files, looked at the vertices of each
polygon and divvyed them up. Oth-
ers have chosen to make the com-
parisons right in their GIS programs
by stacking the geographic layers
and computing how much the poly-
gons overlap.

I have chosen, however, to go with
the Census Bureau's tract-to-tract
relationship files. While the files can
be tricky to explain and are befud-
dling to look at, the good news is
that they're not difficult to use. For
each 1990 tract, the files show how
much of its population went into any
2000 tract. So if a tract was divided
with 20 percent of its population
going into one tract, 30 percent into
a second tract and 50 percent into
a third, the file would indicate that.
You can then use those percent-
ages to assign any 1990 count data
into 2000 tracts and easily compare
changes over time.

Inside the files
The 1990 to 2000 tract relationship
files are available at the Census
Web site at www.census.gov/geo/
www/relate/rel tract.html. The files
I used are the Population-based
Census Tract Relationship files. You
can find files for each state and a
national file, all in fixed-width ASCII,
along with the record layouts you'll
need to import them into a spread-
sheet or database program.

There are 18 fields. Four fields make
up the 1990 FIPS code (state,
county, tract base and tract suffix),
and another four make up the codes
for 2000. There are additional fields
for 2000 with the state abbreviation
and county name.

I suggest importing the relation-
ship tables into the same database
program where you store your
Census data. That way you can
easily link to the tables. Make sure
you format the tract FIPS codes
the same way you have them in
your data. So if you put periods be-
tween the tract base and the tract
suffix, make sure you do the same
in the relationship tables. You'll be
linking these tables to your 1990
and 2000 Census data.

Each record describes the relation-
ship between a 1990 tract and a
2000 tract. Tracts that do not over-
lap have no record. The key parts
of each record are two fields that
describe the relationship between
the 1990 and 2000 tracts. One is
labeled "Percentage of 1990 census
tract population." The other is "Per-
centage of 2000 census tract popu-
lation." If a tract didn't change, both
of those numbers will be 100 per-

cent, since none of the population
has been split up.

There are also flags for 1990 and
2000 indicating whether the record
represents part of a tract. If a 1990
tract was split over two 2000 tracts,
there will be two records in the
table for that 1990 tract - one
record to describe the relationship
to each of the 2000 tracts. In that
case, each of the records will have
a "P" on the 1990 tract FIPS code
to show that the record only de-
scribes a portion of the tract.

There's one very important limit to
using these files: You can use them
only on counts, not on median val-
ues, averages or any other calcu-
lated fields. You can, however, use
them to assign data and generate
your own calculated fields.

An example with the files
I wrestled with the partial-tract
flags and the two numbers de-
scribing "Percentage of 1990 cen-
sus tract population" and "Percent-
age of 2000 census tract popula-
tion" for a while until I realized that
I could throw most of them away.
If I want to assemble 1990 data in
2000 Census tracts the only num-
ber I need is the "Percentage of
1990 Census Tract population." I
named that field "tract90mult,"
which means that is the multiplier
that I use for the 1990 tract to get
the proper share for the 2000 tract.

Let's look at a small example.

The relationship table tells us that
1990 Tract 0001 has 40 percent of
its population in 2000 Tract 0002
and 60 percent of its population in

12

Uplink

2000 Tract 0003. The pertinent parts
of the table would have two records:

1990 Tract FIP (simplified)
2000 Tract FIP (simplified)
Tract90mult
0001 0002 40
0001 0003 60

So if I'm doing a story about Afri-
can-American homeowners and I
want to have a tract-to-tract com-
parison, I would divide the 1990
tract into the 2000 tracts using the
tract90mult value. Note that the
value is expressed as a percent.
But if you multiply by those values,
you'll get results 100 times too
large. You have to divide the
tract90mult by 100 first. I did that
when I imported it. So if the
tract90mult was 100, I turned it into
a 1. In this case, the values be-
come 0.4 and 0.6.

Here are the three steps needed to
calculate:

(1) Link the tract relationship file to
the 1990 data by tract FIPS and
multiply the 1990 value by the
tract90mult.
(2) Sum the new values grouping by
the 2000 tract FIPS.
(3) Link the result to the 2000 data
using the 2000 tract FIPS to do com-
parisons.

Here is how to calculate the rate of
African-American homeowners us-
ing SQL. The 1990 data is in STF1
table H9. The 2000 data is in SF1
table H15B.

select b.tractfip90,
b.tractfip00,
b.tract90mult*a.H0090002
+ b.tract90mult*a.H0090007
as black_hhlds_share,
b.tract90mult*a.H0090002
as black_own_share,

from tblSTF190 a join
1kpTractConvert90_00 b on
a.tractfip90 b.tractfip90
where a.sumlev = 140′

The first step creates the values
black_hhlds_share and
black_own_share that have ad-
justed values. Now I have to ag-
gregate those 1990 values into the
2000 tracts.

select
tractfip00,
sum (black_hhlds_share) as
black_hhlds90,
sum(black_own_share) as
black_own90,
from [the previous SQL
query]
group by tractfip00

Now I have a table with one record
for each 2000 tract with a properly
apportioned share of the 1990 data.
All I have to do is link it to my 2000
data compare by tract.

select
h15bil
as
black_hhlds00, h15bi2 as
black_own00,black_hhlds90,
black_own90, h15bi2
black_own90
as
black_owngain
from tblSF12000 a join [the
previous SQL query] b on
a.tractfip00 = b.tractfip00

You can loop these three queries
into one, which is how I did it. It
looked something like this:

select
h15bil
as
black_hhlds00, h15bi2 as
black_own00, black_hhlds90,
black_own90,black_rent90,
h15bi2 black_own90 as
black_owngain
from tblSF12000 h00 join
(select tractfip00,
round (sum (black_hhlds_share),0)
as black_hhlds90,
round (sum (black_own_share),0)
as black_own90,

from
(select
tractfip90,tractfip00,
tract90mult*h0090002
+ tract90mult*H0090007 as
black_hhlds_share,
tract90mult*h0090002 as
black_own_share,
from tblSTF190 to join
1kpTractConvert90_00 cv on
t0.tractfip00 =
cv.tractfip90
where to.sumlev =
'140' and localyn = 'Y') a
group by tractfip00) b
on g00.stdfip00 =
b.tractfip00

Getting the stories
The first waves of Census stories
have come and gone. Tools like the
tract-to-tract relationship files can
enable news organizations to delve
deeper into patterns. The Washing-
ton Post used a version of the query
above to help map home ownership
for a story that looked at how Afri-
can-Americans had fared over the
1990s in the Washington, D.C., re-
gion and elsewhere.

By using dot density representation
of the counts at the tract level, we
were able to display the 1990 val-
ues and additions in the decade on
the same map. It showed that the
old pattern of African-American
homeowners concentrated in the
District of Columbia had been re-
placed by a wide belt of suburban
homeownership.

By the way, if tracts are too big for
you, the Census has block relation-
ship files that work the same as the
tract relationship files. They're on the
Census Web
site at
www.census.gov/geo/www/relate/
rel_blk.html. There are not any block
group relationship files.
