Uplink Update

For years, the media have been
dropping the ball when it comes to
covering sports. But in many places
homerism has been replaced by hard-
hitting investigations and stories that
cover sports as a business thanks to
CAR.

This issue of Uplink examines
how some news operations are tack-
ling sports' issues.

NICAR's Kara Morrison analyzes
how the Associated Press created its
own database to compare the sala-
ries of Texas high school football
coaches with classroom teachers.

Greg Reeves of the Kansas City
Star explains the computer-assisted
reporting work that helped produce
the Star's latest series on the NCAA.

Griffin Palmer diagrams how The
Daily Oklahoman uses CAR on a
weekly basis to rank local teams.

NICAR's Sarah Cohen explains
how statistics can help sports' staff-
ers, and columnist Nora Paul shares
what is available on the Internet for
sports lovers and writers.

Coaching for dollars

When Linda Leavell heard her AP
story being discussed on a three-hour
Dallas radio program, she knew her in-
vestigative series was a winner.

The story, Leavell said, was one
nearly everyone in Texas could relate to:
hometown high-school football coaches,
revered in many communities, were mak-
ing about 75 percent more than the state's
teachers.

Leavell, a day supervisor at AP's
Dallas bureau, along with reporters Jaime
Aron, Peggy Fikac, Ed Montes, Mark
Babineck and Mike Cochran, put to-
gether a seven-story package called "Pig-
skin Paychecks" that was run by nearly
every media outlet in Texas in October
1996.

The initial legwork was extensive,
because there was no ready-made data-
base compiling the information the AP
needed. The story idea stemmed from
false rumors that coaches often earned
more than their superintendents.

To gather the data, AP sent question-
naires -all hand-tailored and addressed
by name to each superintendent and
complete with the name of each football
coach — to 238 school districts.

Leavell even anticipated compliance
problems, and sent a state attorney
general's open records ruling with each
letter.

"Schools are often notorious for re-
fusing first and complying later, and we
were trying to head that off," Leavell
explained.

Eventually, all 238 districts repre-
senting 428 coaches in the largest Texas
high schools, responded with the infor-
mation. Leavell said most schools re-
sponded quickly, but about 75 or 80 of
them had to be recontacted. Eventually,
she ended up calling all the districts
again to double check the information.

Finally, all the data was entered into
an Excel spreadsheet, which contained
each school name, its district's average
teacher salary, the superintendents' and

Salary analysis

coaches' names and salaries and the school
size.

The numbers spoke for themselves. Leavell
learned head football coaches at the largest
Texas high schools earned about $54,000 on
average — 75 percent more than the average
teacher's $31,000 paycheck. The highest paid
coach made more than $82,000.

Texas coaches receive state-set, base sala-
ries determined by teaching experience, just
like any other teacher. But in addition, coaches
are paid a district-set stipend.

Leavell said she received some help and
suggestions from AP computer-assisted re-
porting experts Bill Dedman and Drew Sullivan
on analyzing and explaining the data.

Dedman's suggestion that Leavell explain
the median salary became a key graph in the
overall piece, making the findings easier to
understand:

"The statewide averages are not inflated by
just a few high-earning coaches," the story
read. "The typical coach makes $54,239. Half
make more, half make less."

The series also used U.S. Census data to
show coaches' salaries were about $25,000 to
$30,000 higher than average Texas household
incomes and those of federal, state and local
government employees.

Along with an overall story on coaches'
salaries, AP's series included profiles of the
highest- and lowest-paid coaches, reactions
from non-coaching teachers, education ex-
perts and state legislators, and even a personal
essay by Mike Cochran, who explained what
his own hometown football coach had meant
to the community.

The series, which took six months to com-
plete, raised questions about the large salary
disparity AP found.

The AP team had also considered compar-
ing each school's academic ranking with its
economic focus on sports, but the reporters
soon learned they couldn't assume a direct link
between the salaries and academic perfor-
mance.

One graph in the series, however, men-
tioned: "Only two schools among the top 50 in
coaches' salaries rank as 'exemplary' in state
academic ratings. Meanwhile, six are consid-
ered 'low performing.""

Leavell said the series brought mixed reac-
tions from the coaches.

"Some were mad, some were accusing us of
singling them out or trying to humiliate them or
stirring up trouble," Leavell said. "Even after it
came out, I had a coach call who said, 'It's not
anybody's business what I make.”

Other coaches were willing to talk frankly
about their pay, which they said often compen-
sated for lack of job security. From compiling the
data, Leavell learned coaching turnover was in
fact high.

"It didn't really occur to me that coaches could
be fired in the middle of the season or would
leave," said Leavell, who learned to specify she
needed only the salary of the coach who had
started the 1995-96 season, rather than the current
coach.

Leavell said if done again, she would have
made this clear in the questionnaire and would
also have asked for the principal's salary.

Because of the series, AP's Dallas bureau
became a model for successfully using the Texas
open records law. Leavell also won the Headlin-
ers Award for the best sports story of 1996 and
received honorable mention in a national AP
contest.

"I was wholly satisfied," Leavell said of the
final project. "It was really successful. It brought
a lot of satisfaction to me personally and brought
a lot of praise to AP in Texas nationally."

Open records tips

Leavell's tips for successful open records act
compliance:

• Know exactly what data you need.

• Tailor specific questionnaires for schools to
fill out.

• Send the letters directly to administrators by
name rather than title.

• Enclose a self-addressed, stamped envelope
and a fax number.

• Keep a detailed log of each follow-up call
you've made to the school, including names of
people you talked to, when you called and what
they said.

• Enclose a state attorney general's decision
about a similar open records case with each letter.

NCAA investigation

by scanning the NCAA membership directory
and 1,200 pages of NCAA convention books
containing 694 legislative proposals since 1993
with accompanying discussion.

And, like several other news organizations,
we used data entry to create tables from the
1996 Gender Equity Disclosure Act forms we
requested from 305 NCAA Division 1 colleges
and universities.

None of the databases in this project were
particularly complicated. The lessons for com-
puter-assisted reporting had more to do with
scanning, data entry and text analysis.

The generated files gave us the ability to
search for statements on NCAA legislation by
school officials and others. It also enabled us to
build a searchable database of every NCAA
legislative proposal since 1993.

The data entry taught me a valuable lesson.
We hired temps, some of them very good, to
input gender equity forms and NCAA infrac-
tion summaries. Then we hired other temps to
proofread the work. At the end we still had
errors embedded in the data — fewer than a
dozen, but dangerously hidden until uncovered
by a query or report.

It would have been cheaper to have two
persons enter the data, then compare the results.
That's how I plan to approach future projects
requiring data entry.

The NCAA graduation-rates database comes
from a complex report submitted annually by
Division 1 schools detailing enrollment and
degrees received in 42 categories by student-
athletes and other students.

Most of the same data is published in the
NCAA's yearly Graduation Rates Report. The
book lists a number range for athletes graduat-
ing in each sport; the database lists the actual
number. We asked the NCAA for this database
and they provided us with four Paradox tables
zipped onto a single diskette.

The database makes it possible to rank schools
by graduation rates of student-athletes or other
students.

We created flags for whether schools were
public or private, and which had the best won-
loss records over the past decade.

These flags, along with fields on gender,
sport, race and athlete type (aid or transfer)
made it possible to analyze graduation rates in
literally hundreds of ways.

The infractions files, which we downloaded
from the NCAA's yet-to-be-released Web site,
totaled more than four megabytes of text. There
were 124 files, some as long as 10,000 words.

As I read each file I typed in brief markers, or
flags, for the source of the infraction (the NCAA,
the school, the press, etc.) and for every penalty
listed (coach fired, sport suspended, etc.).

Then I wrote a short program in XPL, the
Xywrite scripting language, that flew through
the files and threw the file name and flagged text
(usually just a few words) into a file.

I appended this 1,700-line text file to a FoxPro
table, then linked that with the NCAA Enforce-
ment Summary, which lists probation, post-
season bans and television bans for major infrac-
tions since 1952.

We now had a powerful way to analyze
NCAA enforcement trends and show, that tough
measures like bans on post-season play and
television were being replaced by often mean-
ingless probation.

We collected gender equity forms from 305
Division I NCAA schools and analyzed them
about the same time as several other newspa-
pers.

The reports showed that women are 52 per-
cent of students at Division I schools, but only
37 percent of athletes. It also showed schools
overall lost $200 million on sports programs in
1996.

The federal law requires schools to fill out
eight tables, on enrollment, athletic participa-
tion, number of coaches, average coaches' sala-
ries, operating expenses, recruiting expenses,
athletic aid and overall revenue and expenses.
The reports are due Oct. 15 each year.

The NCAA also provided us with diskettes
containing FoxPro tables of more than 100,000
votes by the 933 member schools at the
organization's past four annual legislative con-
ventions.

This database showed how hard it is to cat-
egorize political legislation.

We examined each of nearly 700 proposals
and tried to flag each one with some kind of
meaningful evaluation. In the end, however, the
database told us mainly what the NCAA did and
did not address.

Lax Enforcement
Hunting for data

By Kara Morrison
NICAR
Bill Loving was looking for a quick-hit,
computer-assisted, sports story this spring when
he recalled reading stories analyzing hunting
accidents.

Loving and reporter Dennis Anderson then
came up with an even better twist: analyzing
hunting and fishing violations. Anderson had
heard the Minnesota Department of Natural
Resources had been lax in its enforcement of
violations in recent years.

Loving, computer-assisted reporting editor
at the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, set out to see
what databases were available. To his delight,
the Department of Natural Resources was help-
ful.

"Not only did they have good data going
back to 1987, but they let us have it for free,"
Loving said. "They also agreed to let me
download it via anonymous FTP, instead of
dealing with tapes, etc."

Dissecting the data

The database contained a wealth of infor-
mation, including:
• Type of violation
• Amount of fine
• Date, time and county in which the viola-
tion occurred
• Badge number of the conservation officer
• The outdoor activity involved

From it, Loving was able to confirm
Anderson's hunch.

DNR enforcement had in fact dropped,
while ironically, outdoor activity was at an all-
time high.

The story, which ran on the front page of the
March 27 Star-Tribune, detailed a 28.2 per-
cent drop in total DNR citations from 1991 to
1994.

In that period, hunting and fishing cita-
tions, including tickets for poaching and in-
valid licenses, dropped by an even steeper 32.6
percent.

"A second main finding was that enforce-
ment of game laws was declining while en-
forcement of boat/snowmobile laws was ris-
ing," Loving explained.

"Given that the DNR had been working
with a frozen budget and staffing level for
decades, it looked as if they were making a
conscious choice to re-direct resources away from
hunting/fishing and toward motorized vehicles.
Anderson's reporting confirmed that hypothesis."

Loving said he used Access 97 to establish the
general trends.

He grouped hunting and fishing and motor-
ized-vehicle violations together, grouped them
again by year, and pasted his query results into
Excel. He then used Excel to build a series of
summary tables and charts highlighting his find-
ings.

The database also gave Anderson a good idea
of which officers to interview.

Unfortunately, Loving said most refused to
talk on the record.

But those who spoke to Anderson gave him the
rest of the story, detailing how low morale, bud-
get shortfalls, and a rift between officers and the
enforcement director played a hand in the cita-
tions plunge.

Few problems

The biggest challenge of the project was coor-
dinating schedules with Anderson. This took
months.

After the two found time to work together,
Loving said the story took only a couple of weeks
to complete.

There was only one other slight glitch in the
data that Loving was able to work around. "They
initially withheld the cases in which juveniles had
been ticketed,” he said. "But I later persuaded
them to give me those records, too, but with the
juveniles names deleted."

In all, Loving was pleased with the story,
which he sees as a good example of CAR on the
beat.

"We didn't uncover any major scandals, but it
was an inside look at a public agency that most
people don't know much about," Loving said.
"And given the extreme importance of natural
resources and outdoor recreation in Minnesota, it
shed light on some real concerns about how the
resources were being managed."

Loving recently compiled his own database
using DNR violations to analyze hunting acci-
dents, just in time for start of deer-hunting season.

CAR ranks teams

By Griffin Palmer
The Daily Oklahoman
Much of meat-and-potatoes of day-to-day
sports reporting is driven by statistics. FoxPro is
ideal for processing statistics and getting them
ready to put in the paper.

At The Daily Oklahoman, we use FoxPro to
generate typesetter-ready prep football stand-
ings charts. During the basketball season, sports
reporters use FoxPro to generate win-loss re-
ports for prep teams.

Sports staffer Penny Soldan says she used to
devote an eight-hour day each week to calculat-
ing prep football standings and keying them into
the system. Soldan said she used to spend more
than eight hours a week wrangling numbers for
girls' basketball. She now does the same tasks in
about 30 minutes.

Computer rankings

Because The Daily Oklahoman's newsroom
network is so crotchety, it has been impossible
for us to create a system where agate clerks can
key scores into a central database.

We've worked around the network's limita-
tions by transferring weekly scores files out of
our SII typesetting system, importing them into
FoxPro, and using FoxPro's relational capabili-
ties to write scores from the weekly scores files
to a master schedule.

Then, we use FoxPro's report generator to
create a weekly standings file, including type-
setting codes, from the master schedule. We
transfer that report back to the SII system. It's
a crude solution, but it works.

I've accomplished all this with the FoxPro
training I've gotten at NICAR conferences,
what I've picked up off NICAR-L and other
Internet lists and newsgroups, and what I've
been able to dope out by reading the FoxPro
manuals.

Each summer, The Oklahoman publishes a
master schedule of all prep games. That forms
the nucleus of our weekly standings system.
The sports staff uses SII macros to convert the
schedule into a comma-delimited file, which we
import into FoxPro.

Once a week, we take the scores file pub-
lished in the Saturday paper, convert it to comma-
delimited, and import it into FoxPro.

Then, we run a program that compares the
team, opponent and date fields in the weekly file
with the same fields in the master schedule, and
writes the appropriate scores into the master
schedule.

This gets a little tricky. In the master sched-
ule, every game involving two in-state teams is
listed twice: Once in each team's schedule. The
program has to write each score into the table
twice — in reversed order. Another twist is the
fact that in the weekly scores table, the winner
always appears in the left-hand column; the
loser, in the right.

Our program accounts for all this, and writes
all the scores into the proper columns.

The master schedule contains district win-
loss columns, overall win-loss columns, a col-
umn for a weighted scoring system developed
by our sports staff, a column to indicate district
and non-district games, and an overtime col-
umn.

After writing scores into the correct columns,
the program writes 1s into the appropriate win
and loss columns and calculates weighted scores.
It sums in-district wins and losses, overall wins
and losses and weighted scores for each team,
ordering by win-loss and weighted score within
each class and district.

It stores the results to a separate table, from
which FoxPro generates the report.

I figured out which of FoxPro's special char-
acters correspond to the correct SII typesetting
codes by opening an SII-formatted standings
file into FoxPro's text editor.

I then selected the necessary characters from
FoxPro's menu of special characters and in-
serted them into the report profile as literals.
FoxPro's report generator allows you to build
expressions with FoxPro functions.

I used the iif() function to vary insertion of
SII spacing codes, depending on the number of
bytes written into the win-loss columns and
weighted-score columns.

We sometimes get errors when a team's
name is written differently in the weekly scores
file than in the master schedule.

I've written queries that checks the values in
the master schedule, after the program has run,
against the values in the weekly scores file.
Another query tests for mismatched team names
when the two files don't balance out.

Stats from the Road
Playing with Statistics

By Sarah Cohen
NICAR
It's always surprising that sports reporters
avoid computer-assisted reporting classes of-
fered by NICAR in newsrooms around the
country.

Of course, sports reporters keep strange
hours, are often out of the office, and take
month-long breaks to make up for the grueling
hours they put in during the season. But no
other beat depends so much on framing num-
bers in an entertaining and insightful way.

First, NICAR is looking to help. We're
searching for a good time of year to hold two-
day classes in computer-assisted reporting just
for sports reporters.

Instead of government budgets and school
reports, these would focus on covering high
school football and stadium issues.

Let us know when you think you could fit it
in.

That said, sports reporters have an instinc-
tive understanding of statistics. Here are a few
more tips for sports reporters that can make
those numbers-laden stories just a little more
insightful:

Understand Averages
The single biggest problem in sports report-
ing, particularly on salaries, but also on other
player statistics, is a confusion between the
words, "average" and "typical."

Get to know the concept of a median rather
than a simple average, and use it in your
stories. A median is often called the typical value,
because, for example, it's the middle salary rather
than the total paid divided by the number of
players.

That has a huge effect on what most readers
view as astronomical player salaries.

If one player makes $7.2 million, but the other
eight make closer to $500,000 then the median is
half-a-million. The average is something like
$1.3 million.

Which one more accurately portrays how much
players get? The median.

Which one says more about the finances of the
team? The average.

Pick yours wisely.

Pay attention to the database

Everyone understands in their guts that batting
.333 is very different when a player bats 1-for-3
versus one who bats 33-for-100.

The first could obviously be a fluke. The
second shows consistent performance.

That's easy. But what happens when it's 2-for-
6? Or 3-for-10?

In this space in September, John Sullivan
discussed the use of significance testing in the
newsroom.

Here's an obvious case for a chi-square statis-
tic.

It tells you whether the batting average is
likely to have occurred by chance.

You can use a spreadsheet, a piece of statistical
software, or a pocket calculator to test it. You'd

Sports statistics

set up your test like Table A.

The .449 says that a difference as big as the
one shown could happen about 45 times out of
100 just by pure, dumb luck. In other words, if
a player hits 3-for-10, he might or might not be
better or worse than random chance (or 5-for-
10).

We don't need to set it up to expect hits to
happen randomly.

We can make our test more realistic by
setting them up proportionately. This is usually
a fairer way to test.

Look at Table B.
This time, I calculated "expected" hits by
figuring the team's average of 15 percent hits
(or 15 of 100).

That percentage was applied to our star
player's at-bats to compute the expected 2 of 10
hits, and to the rest of the team to figure the 14
of 90 hits.

Now the 0.000 means that we'd rarely find a
player to do this differently from the average
purely by chance, or 0 of 1,000 times.

Yes, it's a little work to get.

But if your sports story revolves around a
star's performance in a limited number of games,
it's worth checking to see whether this could
happen without any particular talent.

Evaluate players salaries

As many of my colleagues know, I'm not a
big fan of gratuitous use of statistical techniques
in the newsroom.

But player salaries may be one area in which
a regression can help.

The problem is, it's a classic case of a diffi-
cult variable to test using simple linear regres-
sion.

In fact, it's one of the best examples of why
reporters have to pay attention to the kind of data
they're trying to predict or explain using regres-
sion.

In a linear regression, reporters try to guess
a salary, a school's score or any other value
based on a series of other figures that they think
will explain its performance.

In this case, you'd try to guess a salary based
on the idea that better players get paid more. The
trick is to figure out whether it's consistent — if
you get 40 percent more hits, do you almost
always get a 10 percent higher salary?

How can you get a model?

Rather than reinventing the method needed
to accurately predict or explain salaries, borrow
from another field. Studies abound in explain-
ing chief executive salaries in major corpora-
tions.

In fact, one consultant uses a method that
helps tell shareholders whether the executive is
worth the money he or she is paid.

Why not try adapting this model to sports?

These techniques argue strongly for better
use of the information that most sports reporters
keep in books, in nightly reports and in their
heads.

If they'd just type some data into a spread-
sheet instead of writing it on paper, they'd be
able to work through any of these problems on
the fly.

It's worth it.

Tech Tip
One-to-many how-to

By Jo Craven
The Washington Post
Recently, I had a large Home Mortgage
Disclosure Act table called master.dbf that
included a field with Census tract numbers.
The various tract numbers appeared repeat-
edly, indicating the numerous loan applica-
tions that came from each area.

I wanted to identify these tracts by their
common neighborhood names.

To do this, with information provided by a
local Census Bureau, I created a table called
lookup.dbf with two fields: one called "tract"
with the tract numbers, and the second called
"hood" with the neighborhood names.
Master.dbf already contained a tract field; I
added a second corresponding field called
"hood."

My task was to use lookup.dbf to fill in
neighborhood names in the newly created and
blank "hood" field in master.dbf.

To do this, I wrote the following FoxPro
program, which works by advancing through
each table, plucking neighborhood names from
lookup.dbf and dropping them into master.dbf
when the tract numbers from the two tables
match.

Getting technical
In geek speak, this is known as a one-to-
many relationship: One record in lookup.dbf
corresponded to many records in master.dbf.
Here is the program; an explanation fol-
lows:

clear
clear all
close all

use c:\master in 1
use c:\lookup in 2
select lookup

do while not eof('lookup')
scan
select master
replace master.hood with
lookup.hood for
master.tract=lookup.tract
endscan
select lookup
skip 1
enddo

Explanation

clear
clear all
close all

These introductory commands make sure that
you are working with a clean slate — everything
is cleared or closed before the program begins.

use c:\master in 1
use c:\lookup in 2
select lookup

The two tables are opened with the "use
c:\master in 1" and "use c:\lookup in 2" lines. You
must still tell the computer which of these files to
use first. "Select lookup" takes care of this.

do while not eof('lookup')

This acts like a scan loop. It steps through
lookup.dbf. The "not eof" means "not end of file"
and instructs the computer to continue working as
long as it has not reached the end of lookup.dbf.

scan
select master
replace master.hood with
lookup.hood for
master.tract=lookup.tract
endscan

This nested scan loop then selects the second
table, master.dbf, and issues the replace com-
mand, which fills in the empty "hood" field in
master.dbf with a neighborhood name drawn
from the "hood" field in lookup.dbf when
master.tract matches lookup.tract.

select lookup
skip 1

The computer has looked at the first entry in
lookup.dbf, then scanned through every record in
master.dbf and made the appropriate changes.
But the computer still needs to advance to the
next record in lookup.dbf and perform the same
job. "Select lookup" and "skip 1" tells the ma-
chine to return to lookup.dbf, skip one record, and
repeat the procedure. It does this until the com-
puter reaches the end of lookup.dbf.

enddo

"Enddo" concludes the "do while" command.

On the Internet
World Wide Sports

By Nora Paul
The Poynter Institute
In the interest of full disclosure, I'm not
much of a sports fan. I have no special teams I
loyally root for. But I am a dedicated fan of
Uplink so when the assignment for the column
was changed to sports, I didn't try to punt it
back.

After "adult entertainment" sites, there are
probably more Internet sites dedicated to sports
topics than anything else. I don't go to them. In
fact, a friend who runs a big sports server called
to tell me all about his new venture when he was
starting it up and I said, "Oh great, just what the
Internet needs, another damn sports site." I
haven't heard much from him lately.

But then, as often happens, life made me face
something that I had avoided. I had to train
sports copy editors and reporters at the Minne-
apolis Star-Tribune on how to use the Internet.
I had to explore sports sites. And I came away
with an appreciation of some of the services and
their meticulous arrangement and wide scope of
sports information. I also realized that sports
stories aren't just for the sports section, as a big
story in Minneapolis, and in a number of other
communities, has revealed. The hostage taking
of communities by major league sports teams
insisting they need a new stadium or they'll
leave town is a business story, a community
story and a government story.

So, whether you are a copy editor needing
some verification of names and statistics, a
reporter covering a big game or the investigative
reporter needing to background some rich sport
franchises' dealing, here are some sports links
that can help.

Hope they help you pitch a field goal, or
some such thing.

Links pages

Sometimes, finding the site that has the best
collection of links is your first, best bet in
searching.

Rely on "Web scouts" who go out and locate
good sites rather than wading through the vast
listings in large search engine sites. Here are a
couple of good ones:

World Wide Web of Sports
http://www.tns.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/sports
A sort of Yahoo of sports sites, compiled by
students at MIT. The first page will link you to
the listings for specific sports or click the "Sports
Search" link to get a search box and look for
specific items.

Handilinks
http://www.ahandyguide.com/
Check out this guide to Internet resources
categorized in broad subject areas. Click on
sports and get a wonderful listing by sport, from
back-packing to wrestling, with sub-categories
for teams and other topics.

A great way to find the specific Web sites of
particular sports teams, but be careful that you
are looking at the "official" Web site, not just a
fan's ravings.

Tip for finding sports link pages:
Go to the Infoseek search site (www.
infoseek.com) and put in the search box:
+title:links +title:<name of sport.
You'll find pages with the title containing the
word "links" and the name of the sport you are
interested in.

Handout of the Month
When the team leaves home

By Trebor Banstetter
Nashville Banner
The frenzy of big-league sports franchises
pulling up the stakes and moving is one of the
biggest stories to hit sports and business jour-
nalism in years.

In Nashville, the relocation of the Houston
Oilers was the biggest story to hit Music City
in years. I was assigned to cover the story from
a business perspective, and it took the bulk of
my time for more than eight months.

Here are some things to remember when
relocation fever hits your city.

It's a money game

Always remember that professional sports
is a business, and should be covered as such.
Very often we don't look at a football team the
same way we cover the town' s big manufac-
turer, but its likely the team's revenues are just
as high or higher.

Don't worry about the coaches and the
players. Find out the names of the administra-
tors, finance people, marketing and human
relations people — these will be your real
sources.

Early on, do a story profiling the team as a
business. What's its revenue, profit? Who are
its employees? What is its business strategy?
Does it have any subsidiaries? How about its
historical business performance? What else is
the team owner into? (Rarely is the team their
only business).

Since most pro sports teams are closely
held, you'll need to get much of the financial
data from the organization. But surprisingly,
(probably because they're not used to being
covered as a business) they often share a good
amount of information. Other data can come
from the league, and consultants and academ-
ics who track the sports business, and other
business sources. Check state corporate records
and the Securities and Exchange Commission
to find out what other cookie jars the owner has
his hands on and how successful he or she has
been outside of pro sports.

Luxury, luxury, luxury!

The most important element in a team relo-
cation that involves a new stadium is the luxury
box (or skybox, luxury suite, dream suite, etc.)
These suites are gigantic cash generators for the
teams, and usually are the single largest source of
revenue coming out of the stadium every Sunday.

In fact, one sports economics expert told me
that the ideal stadium of the '90s would be 85
percent luxury boxes and about 15 percent seats
to look good on television.

The reason for the importance of the luxury is
twofold. First, they are enormously expensive.

A second reason for the luxury suite mania is
the way they are structured in the stadium lease.
Generally, the suites are managed by a separate
corporation, and the revenues flow directly through
that company, rather than the team.

Of course, the suites that create all this cash for
the team owners are usually built at taxpayeг
expense. Nashville taxpayers will be coughing up
more than $6 million to pay for the suites in our
new stadium.

Who's behind the door?

After identifying the importance of luxury
boxes, a fantastic story to pursue is identifying all
the suite buyers and how much they are paying.
Readers might be interested in knowing if luxury
box owners include non-profit hospitals, public
utilities, companies that have recently laid off
workers, and city government political cronies.
You can also check to see if anyone is getting a
discount or break on their suite and why.

This is not an easy nut to crack. In most cities,
the suite holders list is considered "super top
secret" and they will not hand it over without a
fight.

• Make your own list. Determine the obvious
suspects from the big companies and rich private
citizens in town, and then call around and ask if
they've got luxury boxes. Many will own up,
especially big companies that see the stadium as
an economic development tool. The obvious prob-
lem with this is that you will never get a complete
list, and many of the really interesting luxury box
buyers will never admit they hold suite leases,

• Do some footwork. Work your way into the
suite level of the stadium and look at the doors. In
some stadiums, the suite holders names are printed.
In Boston, a Globe reporter was invited to enjoy
a game in a PR firm's luxury suite at the city's
new Fleet Center, and was able to compile a

complete list. He followed up by calling all the
buyers, and using the standard city and county
documents to identify more obscure names.

• Get a list leaked to you. This isn't easy, but
if you have been cultivating business sources
within the organization, sometimes you can find
a lower-level person with access, who will share
it with you.

• Take the team to court. If your paper or
station has the stomach for this, a good case can
be made that a luxury suite list in a publicly-
funded stadium is public record. In Nashville,
we successfully sued the Oilers and they gave us
copies of all the leases a week later.

The political connection

Politics plays a major role in sports reloca-
tions. Look to see what kinds of deals are getting
cut to get support from the city's legislators. In
addition to just the stadium, lots of "pork" can be
generated on the city and state level to get
widespread support for the project. The paper's
political writers can have a bonanza with this.

Watch the neighbors

Always compare your city to other cities of
similar size that also have new sports teams.

Don't forget philosophy. There is a philo-
sophical element to sports relocations that
screams to be examined. Talk to philosophy
professors, ethicists, and religious leaders about
what the issue says about the community's
priorities. A school teacher may have a very
different perspective that needs to be pursued.
Also, don't forget that there are people who
oppose professional sports on principal, and see
it as violent, exploitive pastime that is a major
waster of civic money. Don't forget to examine
this point of view.

It's a zero-sum game

If your city is getting a team, someone is
losing one (unless it is through expansion, but
that's only a fraction of sports movement to-
day). Always keep close tabs on the city that the
team is leaving. What do they think about it?
People there can tell you what kind of a corpo-
rate citizen the team was, how active the owner
was in the community, how they dealt with
employees, unions, etc. See what kind of mea-
sures the city is taking to save the team. (Hous-
ton, for example, didn't care much at all that the
Oilers were leaving. Even business leaders told
me they would rather go without football and try
to attract a new team than work to keep Bud
Adams in town).

Pick apart the lease

The stadium lease is the real treasure trove of
information. This document spells out exactly
how the facility will be managed, how the rev-
enues will be divided, how contracting will
work, etc. This will be the single most important
document of a sports relocation. Will the team
manage the stadium? In Nashville, a subsidiary
of the Oilers will manage the stadium, even for
non-football events. That subsidiary will essen-
tially have total control over the taxpayer —
funded stadium — they get to choose the events,
the scheduling, and keep 100 percent of the
revenues for most of the stadium functions.

If the team is managing the stadium, look
into what kind of controls the city has. How
often will they be inspected and audited? Who
oversees them? Does the city have the authority
to fire them if its management is inadequate?

Look to the future

A team relocation is like someone leaving
their spouse to marry someone else they re-
cently met and decided they like better. The
danger there is that they've done it before, they
might do it again.

Check the lease for an "escape clause." In St.
Louis, for example, the city's lease with the
Rams has a clause that voids the lease if the
stadium is no longer considered "First Tier."
The problem here is that "First Tier" is not really
well defined, and if the Rams decided in five
years they want to move, that clause will be a
strong tool to persuade a judge that the lease is
null and void. The team would then also have the
option of holding the city hostage and demand-
ing millions in renovation to the facility.

Finally, one great question you must ask the
team owner: Do you plan to permanently move to
our city along with the team? (It's surprising how
many team owners don't live in their host city.)

Scoring with CAR

Program Info
The whole program is too long and klunky
to lay out here, but one part of it is particularly
worth sharing. That's the part that compares
the weekly scores file with the master schedule
and writes scores from the weekly file to the
master file when the appropriate values match.

I've found this program useful when I want
to write data from a source table to a target table
when certain fields match, while retaining the
records in the target table that don't match with
the source table.

An if ... endif command combined with a
seek() function, inside a scan loop, makes this
possible. Here's how it looks. The join field in
the source file (s22score.dbf) must be indexed:

set talk off
use \sports\s22score in 1 order tag
winner of \sports\s22score
use \sports\sked97 in 2
select 2
go top
scan for date='0918' or date='0919'
or date='0920'
scatter memvar
if seek(m.team,1) and
m.opponent=s22score.loser
REPLACE sked97.TEAM_SCORE WITH
s22score.win_score
REPLACE sked97.OPP_SCORE WITH
s22score.los_score
replace sked97.ot with
s22score.ot
endif
endscan

Here's what's going on: The program opens
the source table into work area 1, setting the
index to the winner field. Then, it opens the target
table into work area 2 and sets work area 2 as the
active work area. Then, the scan loop takes over.
The loop moves the record pointer through the
target table one record at a time. The scatter
command stores all fields into memory from the
record on which the pointer is set.

Seek works sort of like scan. It moves all the
way through the specified table (in this example,
the table in work area 1), comparing the indexed
field with the specified search string (in this
example, the memory variable "team"). If seek()
finds a match, it moves the record pointer to the
matching record and returns a .T. value.

Using seek in combination with an if ... endif
command, the program writes data from
s22score.dbf to sked97 every time seek
(m.team, 1) returns true.

Because the whole thing is inside a scan loop,
the same process is repeated for every record in
the table in work area 2.

IRE/NICAR Notes
Database update

By Justin Mayo
NICAR
In NICAR's database library we are continu-
ally trying to expand our database offerings as
well as maintain the most up-to-date existing
collection. Here's a run down of the new and
updated data sets.

Recent Data Acquisitions
Adding to our expanding aviation databases
is the Federal Aviation Administration's En-
forcement Information System (EIS) The EIS
has current and historical data on FAA enforce-
ment actions against airlines, pilots, mechanics
and designees filed from 1962 through mid-
1997. The data set includes information on
hazardous materials, security, drug testing, and
training and maintenance infractions among
others.

Another aviation data set is the National
Transportation Safety Board's Aviation Acci-
dent Database, 1989-1997. This is the NTSB's
version of the FAA's accident and incident
database. Both agencies keep crash data but
with a slightly different focus. The NTSB inves-
tigates civil aviation accidents and incidents
within the United States and in international
waters and has detailed information on the vari-
ables involved in the accident. The database
contains information describing the aircraft,
operations, personnel, environmental conditions,
consequences, probable causes, and contribut-
ing factors of accidents. The NTSB also in-
cludes a narrative of the accident or incident.

NICAR has just finished the 1996 update of
the Center for Disease Control's AIDS data-
base. The data set provides case-by-case demo-
graphic information about Acquired Immuno-
deficiency Syndrome cases reported to state and
local health departments. The information can
provide a detailed look at AIDS in your area,
including demographic breakdowns and risk
factors of those with AIDS in your community.

National Endowment for the Arts, 1987-
1996, has information on individuals or organi-
zations receiving money for arts programs, in-
cluding the type of grant, the total award amount
and a description of the project.

Updated Data
Along with the two new acquisitions, we've
also updated the rest of our aviation data sets.
The FAA's service difficulty reports (SDR), ac-
cidents and incidents, aircraft registration, and
pilot licenses are all current through September
1997.

Additionally, NICAR can set up a monthly
subscription to SDRs for those who want to
maintain the most updated information. NASA's
air safety reporting system, containing anony-
mous complaints by pilots and air traffic control-
lers, is current through August 1997 and is useful
for finding near misses and problems at local
airports, 1988-1997.

Other transportation data sets we've updated:
the National Highway Traffic Safety Adminis-
tration vehicle recalls and complaints, 1966-1997,
includes information about vehicles that have
been recalled by certain manufacturers; Federal
Railroad Administration data for accidents, casu-
alties, and highway crossings, 1991-1996; U.S.
Department of Transportation hazardous materi-
als accidents database, a collection of roadway,
rail, air and waterway accidents from 1971 to
1996; U.S. DOT fatal accident reporting system,
includes all roadway accidents from 1975 to
1996; and U.S. Coast Guard boating accidents,
1969-1996.

The 1996 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act
database is also available. This can be used for
tracking who gets loans and who gets turned
down and for finding redlining patterns.

Up-and-coming Data
Data sets in the offing include the FAA's Near
Mid-Air Collisions database, which is used to
record reports of in-flight incidents where two
aircraft closed to an unsafe distance but avoided
collision. This database serves as a description of
the incident, setting, weather, intended and actual
operations, evasive actions (if any) taken, loca-
tion, flight profile, flight conditions, aircraft and
aircrew data for the two involved aircraft.

The following NICAR databases are presently
being updated: the 1996 National Bridge Inven-
tory System data, including inspection grades,
will be available in December; Occupational
Safety and Health Administration violation data,
including worker accidents and exposures to haz-
ardous chemicals by companies, will be also
ready in December.

Campaign Finance
The Campaign Finance Information Center is in full
swing. Data, tips, links and stories are on the center's Web
site, www.campaignfinance.org
Also, coming soon to a mailbox near you will be the
Campaign Finance Information Center's newsletter. Sto-
ries from the Fall '97 newsletter include reports about states
with electronic filing systems, a look at how states are
going to inform the public of the connection between
money and politics and an explanation of in-kind contribu-
tions.

Conferences and Seminars
NICAR is forging ahead with new seminars and new
approaches to conferences and workshops. The annual
conference, March 5-8 in Indianapolis, will not only in-
clude the usual panels and hands-on classes for beginners
to the advanced, but also a set of special half-day sessions
that will take in depth looks at how to use electronic
information for particular beats.
We also are expanding our seminars for the intermedi-
ate range. Earlier this year we did a seminar on education
and statistics. In the coming months, we plan to hold
seminars on database design and data cleaning, use of SQL
servers for the newsroom, mapping software, and business
reporting. Watch our website at www.nicar.org for dates
and times. For more information on seminars and boot
