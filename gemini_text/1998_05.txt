HEALTH CARE INVESTIGATION
Wrestling giants
By Josh Barbanel
The New York Times
We were gathered in a tiny windowless
conference room at The New York Times noo-
dling over what was undoubtedly going to be
an epic tale of the troubled American health
care system. But which epic would it be?
For weeks, Martin Gottlieb, Kurt
Eichenwald and Tamar Lewin had traveled
around the country meeting with sources,
reviewing court and agency records, explor-
ing the troubling business strategies that
turned Columbia/HCA Hospital Corp. into
a $20 billion health care giant, the world's

INTERSTATE TRAPPINGS
Sudden Seizures
By David Washburn
The Morning Call
(formerly Dateline NBC)
Dateline NBC's IRE award-winning
investigation of a Louisiana sheriff
department's illegal use of drug forfeiture
money-"Probable Cause" - started with
a ski trip in Aspen. It ended with a
cardboard box filled with photocopied
checks and a Microsoft Access database.
It was a week-long luxury ski trip.
Four Jefferson Davis Parish police depu-
ties rented a condo, bought ski clothing
in ritzy boutiques and took to the slopes.
Police billed the trip as "deputy train-
ing."
All expenses were paid with money
police seized from alleged drug dealers in
Louisiana, mostly along Interstate 10.
Louisiana Legislative Auditor Daniel
Kyle investigated this 1990 ski trip and
found that not only was it bogus but an
illegal use of drug forfeiture money. An
additional $200,000 was missing. One

largest health care provider.
After a few days on the road in places like
Tallahassee and Baltimore, I stayed back at
the office staring at my computer screen. I
was trying to make sense of a carton filled
with 89 computer cartridges containing more
than 30 million medical billing records
perched on the edge of my desk.
As we reviewed our findings - tales of
hard-ball takeover practices, questionable
incentives for doctors to switch hospitals and
bring their patients with them-we struggled
over fundamental questions of fairness.
Was this a story about a greedy for-profit
company that went way too far? Or a story
about the sorry state of the entire American
health care system? Was Columbia/HCA a
special case or were not-for-profit hospitals,
facing the same pressures, doing exactly the
same things? Were we picking on the wrong
guy?

Analytical evidence
At this pivotal moment in the project, I
was able to lean forward on the sagging couch
and pull out the computer-assisted reporting
analysis of medical billing records. I argued
that they provided the strongest and clearest
evidence yet that Columbia/HCA was sim-
ply different from other hospitals and needed
to be treated that way.
The analysis showed that Medicare re-
cipients who were treated at Columbia/HCA
hospitals in Texas cost the government mil-
lions of dollars more than patients treated at
other hospitals. Their costs were higher than
costs at all other hospitals, particularly when
the entire cost of care included the hospital
stay through skilled nursing, rehabilitation
and home health care. Their costs were far
higher than the costs at comparable not-for-
profit hospitals.

HEALTH CARE IN THE ARMED FORCES
System protecting
military malpractice
By Stuart Watson
WRAL-TV
Stuart Watson attended the NICAR basic
boot camp in August 1995.
Normally I'm terrible at phone tips. To
my detriment. If Deep Throat called, I'd put
'em on terminal hold, then cut 'em off.
Maybe that's why my colleagues rib me about
being more at home with a stack of docu-
ments or a database. But it was hard to hang
up on Kristie Piittmann. She called March
22, 1995, to say Army medicine killed her
baby.
Having firsthand witnessed labor and de-
livery four times, her story hit home. You
could see it happening. The fever. The racing
fetal heartbeat. The antibiotics administered
too late. The awkwardness of telling the
mother when Cole Piittmann was born a few
weeks before Christmas 1994. Then the rush
to a civilian hospital and the parents' ultimate
choice: handing over the infant to be airlifted
to Duke University with little hope of sur-
vival or unhooking all the tubes and letting
their only son die in their arms. They chose
the latter.
It was a heart-rending story, all right, the
news director said, but how was it different
from allegations of malpractice in a civilian
hospital among civilian doctors? In other
words, you have a story – now what is the
report? What is the meaning, the context?
The full answer would take two and a half
years of reporting.

Alley cats
We went down a number of blind alleys
before finding the lessons of Cole Piittmann's
death. First we checked the death rates at the
military hospital against death rates in the
neighboring civilian hospital. Fewer infants
died at the military hospital. Then we checked
the status of infants transferred from the
military hospital to civilian hospitals using a
database of death records downloaded from
the Web. Finally we checked the number of
infants at various hospitals who died of Group
B strep infections like Cole Piittmann had.
The alleys led nowhere.

The next set of blind alleys concerned the
doctors. We filed Freedom of Information
Act requests asking whether Kristie
Piittmann's doctors had ever been sued be-
fore. The Army denied us saying it couldn't
find such information, that doctors' names
aren't linked to malpractice claims, and even
if they were, the information was exempt
from public inspection.
We also asked whether the doctors had
ever been disciplined. Again denied. An Army
doctor's disciplinary history - short of court-
martial - is exempt from public disclosure.
But the U.S. Army Claims Service at Ft.
George Meade in Maryland mentioned a
database. Did somebody say 'database'? We
filed an FOI request.
The Army withheld names and identify-
ing information for claimants. But after one
appeal, the Army included the names, ad-
dresses and phone numbers of attorneys.
Some attorneys proved helpful in tracking
down old clients. The U.S. Army CLAIMS
database arrived in the form of a tiny cassette
not much bigger than an audio cassette. We
didn't have a player. After consulting CAR
gurus on the NICAR listserv, we hired a local
data house to transfer the cassette to nine-
track tape. Though we didn't have a nine-
track tape drive in house, our corporate data
processing officer did. We begged him to
clean it up and FTP it to us.
All of this took months. The corporate
data processors would ask little questions
like, "Do you want us to clean this Army data
or do you want your paycheck this week?" In
the end, we had a complete database of every
tort claim filed against the Army for about
eight years.
This database could have told us the type
and rates of malpractice claims at various
military hospitals. But there were all sorts of
caveats. Some hospitals were much larger.
Some might have been in areas where more
aggressive trial attorneys recruited and en-
couraged military families to sue. In the end,
we primarily used the data to track down
similar malpractice cases at the same facility.

Civilian differences
Then I bumped into Russell Carollo, an
investigative reporter at the Dayton Daily
News. I had called Carollo in the summer of
1996 to ask how he got information about
missing and stolen military weapons. He had
shared his data, provided that we credited his
news organization, which we did.

The military protects
bad medicine. Military
doctors do not carry
their own malpractice
insurance like civilian
doctors, are not sued
like civilian doctors
and are not disciplined
like civilian doctors.

I mentioned that I was interested in
medical malpractice in the military. He
said, “Stuart, the stars have aligned. We've
been working on this for months." Carollo
and Jim Stewart at CBS News helped
sharpen our focus. They said they didn't
think we would ever be able to fairly com-
pare malpractice rates at military and civil-
ian facilities. They said the systems were
too different.
The story, they said, was the differences
between the two systems and how those
systemic differences left military families
unprotected against malpractice. Fore-
most, active duty soldiers, sailors, airmen
and marines could not even file malprac-
tice claims. Doctors were not named indi-
vidually in claims. Military doctors didn't
carry their own malpractice insurance. And
disciplinary records were hidden. (We
knew this last fact from our FOIA experi-
ence.)
Carollo and Jim Nesmith at the Cox
News Service had already done considerable
work. Carollo offered to share if WRAL
didn't air the report before the Dayton Daily
News went to print.
Carollo had accumulated databases of mili-
tary doctors from all branches. We later split
the cost of hiring a data entry house recom-
mended by a NICAR listserv member to
input the Public Citizen list of more than
13,000 "questionable" doctors and run it
against the databases of military doctors.
We then shared the grunt work of filing
open records requests with various state medi-
cal boards to ensure the doctors mentioned
in the Public Citizen list were the same ones
in the military databases.

Research reaction
The years of research paid off in Octo-
ber 1997 when WRAL-TV, the Dayton
Daily News and the Cox News Service
reported how the military protects bad
medicine.
Military doctors do not carry their own
malpractice insurance like civilian doc-
tors, are not sued like civilian doctors and
are not disciplined like civilian doctors.
The Pentagon does not report to the
National Practitioners Data Bank the same
information as the civilian world does.
And, unlike civilian doctors, military
doctors can continue to practice after re-
peatedly failing state medical exams.
The Army Times, Navy Times, Air Force
Times and wire services all ran Carollo and
Nesmith's series. WRAL aired a five-part
series and a half-hour special report.
The Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Health Affairs responded with a 13-point
plan for improving military health care.
The Surgeons General of the Army, Navy
and Air Force were called to a closed-door
meeting with the National Security Sub-
committee of the House Appropriations
Committee. The subcommittee later set
aside $5 million for an expert panel to
evaluate the quality of military health care.
The Pentagon pulled doctors who failed
medical exams from clinical positions.
And it all started with a phone call, a
massive database, and lots of teamwork with
NICARians!

FALLING OUT OF THE BLUE
Undeserved overtime
By Dan Keating
The Miami Herald
In late April, Metro Dade Police - the
largest agency in south Florida-punished 36
officers, the largest disciplinary effort in its
history. Supervisors were demoted and offic-
ers were suspended without pay for a wide-
spread scam in which officers, even if they
had not performed any police work, added
their names to arrest reports in order to
collect court overtime.

It's usually hard to turn
multiple records into
individual summaries
with such a wide variety
of information. We
used SAS because it
can manipulate a group
of records to produce a
single summary record.

The department's nine-month internal
investigation was prompted by The Miami
Herald's 1997 investigation, "Collars for
Dollars." In April, the project was named a
Pulitzer finalist in the investigative category.
The story pulsed with rich anecdotes pro-
duced by the shoe-leather effort of three
reporters on The Herald's investigative team.
Its foundation lay in ironclad assertions drawn
from data analysis, which involved nine dif-
ferent criminal justice datasets from a variety
of sources.
The key ingredient was the court's elec-
tronic docket that lists officers subpoenaed to
court. We obtained records of 704,077 offic-
ers subpoenaed in 143,055 felony, misde-
meanor, juvenile and traffic cases in Dade
County from 1994 through 1996. Our main
goal was to tally how many officers were
coming to court and then calculate by case,
agency, officer and charge.
The hard work wasn't analyzing the data
- it was organizing it.
Unfortunately, the raw data was struc-
tured in a format that couldn't be used for
effective analysis. The database arrived in two
tables. One table listed the case number,
charge and disposition. With separate records
for every charge, each case could have a dozen
records or more. The second table had one
record for each subpoena, listing the case
number, agency, officer and hearing date. It,
too, could have a dozen records per case.
Although the tables were related by case
number, any attempt to join them produced
a mishmash of up to 100 records for an
individual case.

The multiplicity challenge
Before we could do anything, we had the
tricky chore of reshaping the data. We needed
a single record to summarize each case, but
we couldn't lose the ability to pinpoint spe-
cific officers or charges.
For the charges, we made a single sum-
mary record for each case. The record in-
cluded the first eight charges (if that many
were included), a count of the total number
of charges, and dispositions.
To be able to quickly find particular kinds
of cases, we created yes/no flags for several
types of charges: from murder and robbery to
prostitution and drunk driving. If a case
involved any of those charges, its flag was set
to "yes." Since the project concentrated on
misdemeanors, the flags let us quickly run
statistics on those cases.
We also created a single record for each
case in the subpoena database. It included the
total number of officers subpoenaed, the
names of up to three departments and how
many officers were subpoenaed from each. It
also noted the officer and department that
initiated the case. That showed us how groups
of officers piled onto cases.
It's usually hard to turn multiple records
into individual summaries with such a wide
variety of information. We used SAS because
it can manipulate a group of records to pro-
duce a single summary record.
To be able to find specific officers, we kept
a dataset listing one subpoena per record. A
name search would draw up all the case
numbers for a given officer. The case num-
bers could then be linked to the charge sum-

the
Once we had the SAS program to reshape
felony/misdemeanor data, we could change
file names to run the same operation on the
juvenile data and then the traffic data. That
ability to recycle SAS code and repeat a lengthy
series of steps came in handy since we ended up
getting four sets of the traffic data before the
court folks finally produced a database includ-
ing all police witnesses on a case.

In any analysis, a
baseline for comparison
is the most important
part: What can we use
to define what's normal
or abnormal?

Gone fishin'
With the data reshaped, it was time to
actually analyze it. First, we cast a sweeping
net through the data to catch tips (cases and
officers) for the reporters to track down.
We specified a kind of case using the yes/
no flags and then grabbed the cases with the
most witnesses. We also pulled the officers
whose cases averaged the highest number of
witnesses.
To see who was in the habit of joining
with a friend, we checked how many times
any two officers appeared together on a case.
To do that, we made a temporary duplicate of
the subpoena dataset in order to compare it
with itself.
With help from my predecessor and men-
tor, Professor Steve Doig of the Cronkite
School of Journalism at Arizona State Uni-
versity, we used the following code. It's SQL
code, but for this story run under SAS. You
might find it useful anytime you're trying to
match a dataset against itself to pull out pairs.
The original dataset was named subpl
and the duplicate subp2. In the duplicate, the
officer identification was renamed copid2
and the case number was renamed casenum2.

The code uses a "less than" on the officer
identification number so that each pair can
be listed only one way (you won't have both
"Keating-Doig" and "Doig-Keating"):
create table witness.subp3 as
select subpl.copid,subpl.casenum,
subp2.copid2, subp2.casenum2
from subpl, subp2
where subpl.casenum =
subp2.casenum2
and copid lt copid2
order by 1, 2;

The code produced a table of matched
pairs with case numbers. We then grouped
by the pairs and counted to find which offic-
ers appeared together the most. We could
also see all the cases of any given pair.
Using those techniques, we found plenty
of cases worth checking out. At least six
police witnesses appeared in 128 misde-
meanor prostitution cases. Two officers (close
friends) were listed 238 times as witnesses in
each other's drunken-driving cases, even
though they worked for different depart-
ments in different jurisdictions.

Publication precision
To produce statistics for publication, our
analysis had to be more precise. We consid-
ered other complicating factors, such as offic-
ers subpoenaed only to testify about the
calibration of the breathalyzer, the tiny pro-
portion of cases with guilty pleas at arraign-
ment, or cases with multiple defendants.
In any analysis, a baseline for comparison
is the most important part: What can we use
to define what's normal or abnormal? In our
case, we had four major police departments,
three that pay for court overtime and one that
does not.
That made it easy to draw comparisons.
For instance, the department that doesn't
pay for overtime was 100 times less likely to
have at least five officers on a DUI case. The
three departments that paid overtime had
6,445 routine DUI cases with at least five
officers in three years. Experts said three
officers would be the maximum needed to
prosecute a case.

Continued from page one: Bold profiteers
And why not? Columbia/HCA ran both
the hospitals and the home health care agen-
cies - and everything in between. They were
aggressively trying to maximize their profits.
We didn't know it then, but we were still
at the early stages of an investigation that
would take more than a year before the first

investigative hunches

word made it into print. And the computer-
assisted analysis kept the project focused
squarely on Columbia/HCA and its prac-
tices. Over the ensuing months, as more
allegations and information surfaced, we were
able to use the same approach again and
again. The interplay of data analysis and
investigative hunches and leads brought this
project to life.
The data analysis allowed the team to
move from a specific allegation to an exami-
nation of an entire hospital conglomerate
and how the government regulated it.

Share-raising story
Eventually we pointed to problems and
possible illegalities in many important areas
of Columbia's operation that stemmed from
the company's single-minded quest for prof-
its and an ever higher price per share.
We looked at schemes to overbill Medic-
aid for millions of dollars per year, evidence
that Columbia executives promised jobs and
incentives to administrators of hospitals it
was trying to buy, and data suggesting that
some doctors who joined partnerships with
Columbia skewed their admitting practices
to enrich their investments. There were sto-
ries on the misuse of foundations set up when
Columbia purchased not-for-profit hospitals
and computer-assisted evidence that admin-
istrators inflated cost reports to the govern-
ment to increase Medicare payments and cut
care to the uninsured poor after a hospital
purchase.
And finally, while Columbia/HCA had
argued that its cost-cutting had led to lower
prices for patients and thus a benefit to the
public at large, the investigation found that
care at Columbia hospitals actually cost sig-
nificantly more than care at comparable in-
stitutions.
Writing about Columbia/HCA required
us to connect dots that most often had re-
mained unconnected. It was uncharted terri-
tory, at least for us, and sometimes informa-
tion that we came across in the first few weeks
didn't make sense or assume importance
until months later.
The computer-assisted reporting grew out
of investigative hunches we kicked around at
the very start of the project. Columbia/HCA
had consolidated whole segments of the health
care industry and increased their profitability
at the same time.

Troubling episode
We decided to look at the entire cost of
care whether provided by Columbia/HCA-
owned hospitals, skilled nursing units, home
health care units or doctors who had invested
in Columbia/HCA.
For Medicare patients, the Health Care
Financing Administration keeps all the
records and bills and gives researchers access
to some of them for medical and policy
research. We obtained separate billing records
for physician visits, hospital stays, skilled
nursing care, medical equipment and home
health care. These records were all linked
together by an encrypted patient Medicare
number.
But what could we do with these records?

six:
My approach in this situation is to find
researchers who have done parallel medical
or social science work, then adapt and extend
their methods to solve a reporting problem
using administrative records.
This time, I found that there was a body
of work in the medical literature examining
"episodes" of care what happens in the
course of medical treatment both in and out
of the hospital.
Our team used the Times mainframe and
ran through millions of patient records. We
combined all the bills and calculated the entire
cost of an episode of hospital care from the day
of admission until 30, 60 or 90 days later.
To make these comparisons fair and rea-
sonable, we adjusted the cost figures for the
differences in diagnosis and severity based on
information coded in each hospital record. A
variety of statistical methods were used to
examine the statistically significant results.
As we suspected, Columbia/HCA hospi-
tals had shorter length of stays during initial
hospitalizations - where Medicare pays a
fixed cost for a particular illness no matter
how many days a patient is in the hospital
and longer stays in skilled nursing units
where Columbia/HCA is paid by the day.
Costs were roughly the same or lower for
Columbia for the initial stay. But they were
significantly higher when the entire episode
of care was included.
This work helped keep us focused on what
was special and troubling about Columbia/
HCA and its aggressive practices, rather than
a more general hand-wringing approach about
the changing health care system.

Applied training
It also trained us to work with the Medi-
care records and prepared us for more pro-
vocative findings later on.
Months later, we learned of allegations
that a Columbia/HCA hospital in Tennessee
was miscoding medical records to increase
reimbursements from the Medicare system.
There were four diagnosis codes for four
different kinds of pneumonia, each with a
different Medicare payment level. The Co-
lumbia hospital was far more likely to code to
the highest paying - and most profitable
illness than surrounding hospitals.
Now that we were experienced hospital
researchers, we applied that experience to the
new allegation. Within a day or so, we showed
that this pattern was repeated across Texas
and Florida. When we ranked hospitals in
both states on the percentage of cases coded
to this high paying category, Columbia/HCA
hospitals ranked at the top of the list in both
states.
We had obtained four years of Florida
state hospital records and were soon able to
document that Columbia/HCA hospitals
increased the proportion of cases coded to the
most profitable category.
We also used annual financial and cost
reports compiled by Florida and the federal
Medicare agency. When we learned that
Florida required hospitals to file reports show-
ing all doctors who are investors and referred
patients, we obtained them on paper and
created a database. This allowed us to exam-
ine doctors who admitted patients to two or
more hospitals to look for evidence that their
investments influenced their practice pat-
terns.
To process all that data, we used an IBM
mainframe at the Times and were forced to
learn how to do some complicated program-
ming in SAS. Once we produced interim
results, we brought them down to PCs and
did more work in FoxPro, SPSS and various
spreadsheets.
When Columbia suggested that the dif-
ferences in costs had to do with hospital size
or other factors, we ran regressions to show
that the differences remained significant af-
ter accounting for hospital variables such as
wage differences, size, and whether the hos-
pital carried out teaching programs.
All this work produced an initial series of
five stories and then 30 other stories by Kurt
Eichenwald on government investigations.
This in turn led to the ouster of Richard
Scott, the chairman of Columbia/HCA and
most of his top aides who had shaped the
company's policies and personality. The new
management team promised reforms that
addressed, almost point for point, the major
issues raised in the series.

Continued from page ome: Forfeiture abuse
Louisiana police officer called the ski trip just
the tip of an illegal iceberg.
Dateline producer Patrick Weiland had
been keeping an eye on the story since 1994.
He was hearing outrageous accounts of po-
lice officers pulling motorists over on I-10
and shaking them down for cash, seizing cars
and property without any evidence, targeting
minority drivers for traffic stops and misus-
ing funds in the drug forfeiture account.
"We talked to a few people and the under-
the-table stuff they were talking about was
incredible," Weiland said.

Set up to shakedown
The key to the story was the law itself and
how it differs from every other state. In most
states, seized drug money goes into a state-
wide crime fund. In Louisiana, individual
police departments get to keep 60 percent of
everything they seize. And much of that goes
directly to the officers who make the busts.
This gives local police ample incentive to
seize as much money and property as pos-
sible. So much incentive, said Weiland's
sources, that motorists traveling Interstate 10
were getting pulled over every day for bogus
reasons by officers acting more like shake-
down artists than cops.
Weiland filed a Freedom of Information
Act request for five years' worth of checks
written against the drug forfeiture account in
Jefferson Davis Parish. He was granted access
to the records, but only on paper. The parish
didn't keep the records on computer.
In fact, when associate producer Lindsey
Schwartz went down to the parish to get the
records, she found 1,500 photocopies of
checks stashed away in a cardboard box.
"The checks were coming back from the
bank and just put in the box," Schwartz said.
"No one ever looked at them."
After a few hours of going through the
copies, Schwartz realized two things: She had
the evidence they were looking for and she
needed help.
We designed a simple table in Microsoft
Access based on the check. It included the
check number, the date of the check, the
payee and the amount.
That was the easy part. The hard part was
entering information from 1,500 checks.

Glazed assets
After three weeks of entering data, it took
just a few queries to find out that police were
spending seized money all over town.
Thousands of dollars were spent at local
restaurants including Mr. Gatti's and Bruce's
Donut King; $3,800 was spent at Wal-mart
and $8,000 at the local hardware store. Un-
documented checks totaling $60,000 went
to one of the sheriff's deputies.
"They say they are fighting the war on
drugs," Weiland said. "So they pull people
over without reasonable cause, take their

"They say they are
fighting the war on
drugs. So they pull
people over without
reasonable cause, take
their money and spend
it on donuts."

money and spend it on donuts."
The investigation prompted another au-
dit by the state's legislative auditor and legis-
lation introduced by the governor that changes
burden-of-proof laws and makes it more
difficult to seize property.
The computer played a relatively small
role in the months-long investigation. How-
ever, it helped Weiland and Schwartz take
the story beyond anecdotal accounts.
"It placed into context the extent of the
misuse," Weiland said. "And it gave us hard
evidence to prove how they were using the
money."
This story is another example of the benefits to
building your own database. Entering hundreds,
sometimes thousands, of records can be a daunt-
ing task. But you are doing something the agency
compiling the records hasn't done, and you are
looking at their data in ways they haven't. Sec-
ondly, you avoid the "dirty data" issues inherent
with data entered by a $5-an-hour clerk.

STATS FROM THE ROAD
CAR with microdata
By Paul Overberg
USA Today
Microdata is a word from the social sci-
ences. Loosely, it means data at the level at
which it's collected. More specifically, it of-
ten means the individual records that result
from a carefully designed survey where the
unit is often a single person, household,
incident or something similar. Microdata is
usually contrasted with macrodata, a generic
term for various levels of summarization and
cross-tabulation.

Why bother?
If you're thinking, "Microdata! Fancy
word for something I already do!" you're
wrong. True microdata can be much more
rewarding. You can do cross-tabulations that
no one else has ever done - and find news.
But it's also trickier. It's often produced by a
survey or statistically random selection, so
each record represents a larger number of its
type in the entire population. But we have to
preserve and use each record's weight cor-
rectly. Depending on the survey's precision,
weights can vary a little or a lot from record
to record. It's often collected in a hierarchical
file, something akin to interleaving the tables
of a relational database. For instance, the
Current Population Survey, done monthly
by the Census Bureau for the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, collects information about
50,000 households into one big file with
three record types for their personal, family
and household characteristics. Often, a re-
searcher will pull data from the people and
household records into a new working file.
This is called rectangularizing.

Household 1 all data
Family 1
all data
Person 1
all data
Person 2
all data
Person 3
all data

becomes in a working file
Person 1 some data and
Household 1
some data
Person 2
some data and
Household 1
some data
Person 3 some data and
Household 1 some data

This turns the hierarchical file into a flat
(rectangular) file that's smaller and easier to
analyze. If you've ever analyzed the Fatal
Accident Reporting System (FARS) data from
the National Highway Traffic Safety Admin-
istration, you've faced this. For each fatal
accident record, there's one or two or more
related vehicle records, each of which has
one, two or more related person records.

Before using microdata...
Don't if you don't have to. Often,
summary data is all you need. Start there.
Read the standard reports published by the
keeper of the data. Look in the back for
detailed cross-tabulations if the standard sum-
maries aren't enough. For instance, median
household income appears right up front in
the Census Bureau's annual report on in-
come. Dig a little and you can find median
income by race (all whites). Dig deeper and
you can find median income by race by age
group (whites 45-54). Dig deeper and you
can find median income by race by age by
education (whites 45-54 with a bachelor's
degree), deeper still for median income by
race by age by education by work status
(whites 45-54, bachelor's degree, work full-
time) and even deeper still for median in-
come by race by age by education by work
status by region (whites 45-54, bachelor's
degree, work full-time, Midwest).
Talk to whoever keeps the data before you
spend a week plowing into a microdata maze.
They may have done what you're attempting
or have good advice on how to do it (or why
not to).
Learn the data thoroughly. This is espe-
cially true for microdata based on surveys or
hierarchical files. Read the appendix on the
sampling design. Read the file list and values.
Try to duplicate published calculations.
Learn SPSS or SAS. Either will do, but
knowing neither leaves you fumbling with
spreadsheets and database managers. They
may work, but they're sort of like using a
regular srewdriver on a Phillips head screw:
You have to work harder and still may get
inferior results.

HANDOUT OF THE MONTH
Steps to data freedom
By Michael J. Berens
Chicago Tribune
Ancient warrior wisdom is based on the
belief that the battle is won or lost before the
first sword is drawn. Likewise, the fight for
data must be plotted before the first request
is filed. Understanding the buzz words - the
warrior language, if you will - will go far in
negotiations.

Study the file layout
Skip this vital first step at your peril. Trust
me. Take time to do this or risk major set-
backs in time and money. The file layout is a
document that shows data organization and
structure. It serves as a blueprint for obtain-
ing, importing and analyzing data. Code keys
are a list of standardized abbreviations, acro-
nyms or numbers that represent informa-
tion. For example, states may be represented
as numbers in the database.
Study file layouts before making requests.
For example, the database layout of the Na-
tional Highway Traffic Safety Administra-
tion lists hundreds of fields involving fatal
vehicle crashes. One field, called the "related
factors" field, uses a code number to desig-
nate if the fatality was related to a police
pursuit. An entire series can - and has – been
built on one field.
Layouts also reveal a major pitfall for the
unwary: packed fields.
Typically, packed fields hold information
that is encrypted and condensed as a space-
saving technique. Unless fields are unpacked,
you may not be able to read the information.
Often, government data is stored in mul-
tiple files, called a relational database. Exam-
ine layouts for a common field, which is
necessary for linking files.

Handling Formats
This is the step where some bureaucrats
love to leave reporters in the dust. Learn
about the types of formats your software can
handle. However, most any database can be
copied as an ASCII file. This is an acronym
for standardized computer format that is
recognizable by all mainstream software
(FoxPro, Access, Excel, File Maker Pro, etc.)
Most software also can handle multiple
formats, such as DBF or text format or for-
mats managed by software applications.
Next, you must determine how the data is
delimited – how it will be separated. Many
reporters will ask for data in ASCII format
(an industry standard) and delimited by com-
mas. During importing, the computer will
separate the data into new fields at each
comma. You can have the data delimited by
spaces, or tabs, or most anything, if preferred.

Medium messengers
You've followed the first two steps flaw-
lessly, the agency quickly delivers your data-
and it's on a 4mm tape cartridge. This hap-
pened at the Tribune when a reporter forgot
to request the medium, which is the all-
important third step. Needless to say, few
newspapers have 4mm tape drives to read the
data. Determine what formats your paper
can handle, such as disks or cartridges or
tapes. Besides disks, here are some other
choices:
• Nine-track tapes - Used by many gov-
ernment agencies, but you will need a special
nine-track reader attached to your computer.
• JAZ Cartridges - These tapes hold 1 gig
or more of data. JAZ drives are common and
increasingly more inexpensive.
• ZIP Cartridges - Similar to JAZ, but
typically these cartridges hold less informa-
tion.
• FTP (File Transfer Protocol) -This isn't
a storage medium, but it's a dream way to
obtain data. In short, the agency temporarily
places the requested data on its Web page,
allowing you to transfer the data via the Web
into your computer. No tapes, no disks, no
special readers. And it's more efficient for
agencies.

Roadblocks and solutions
The pursuit of data is no laughing matter,
but government response can border on the
ridiculous. Here are actual government ob-
jections encountered nationwide. The suc-
cessful strategy centers on getting past the
flak phalanx and talking directly to the
agency's data processing employees.
• Our computer can't do that.
• You'll never understand the data. It's far
too complex. We're afraid you'll make mistakes

Data battle plan
and draw wrong conclusions.
• It's too big. You'll never have a computer
to handle it.
• Our software is proprietary, so you can't
have the data.
Data negotiations are fought with knowl-
edge and confidence. More than once I've
had a new term thrown at me during a
meeting. Don't panic, don't flinch. Keep
smiling, say no problem, then later run to
someone in the newspaper's data processing
department to find out what the term meant
and whether it's actually going to be a
problem. Don't let the agency bluff you, but
don't be afraid to do a little bluffing, too.
Demand specifics, then demand proof.
IRE and NICAR have excellent resources for
those confused by techno-babble such as
megs and gigs (terms related to data storage).

Don't be afraid to ask basic questions. Ask
the agency computer people how they relate
multiple files: you may learn their method is
more complex - but more accurate than
your plan.
Another psychological negotiating ace is
to assure the agency that you plan to provide
them a copy of all analysis (we're talking
aggregate conclusions and totals) prior to
publication. I love the moment I get to show
the agency what their own data reveals. And
more than once, I've been saved from pub-
lishing incomplete conclusions. Remember,
the potential for errors is exponentially higher
in CAR reporting. You're just one keystroke
away from an error, always.

Continued from page five: Excuse-proof data
tion rate for a DUI declined as the number of
officers involved increased. That finding made
it impossible for police to claim that extra
officers ensured a conviction.
We created another database from the
logs of the breathalyzer machines. We
punched in the names of defendants whose
breath-alcohol readings were below the legal
limit, then merged the defendant names
against the DUI court cases. More than half
of those cases had been dismissed outright,
meaning that hundreds of people were being
charged with DUI even though tests showed
they were not legally intoxicated. Although
it's hard to prove that police are intentionally
arresting innocent people to drum up court
overtime, our finding from the data certainly
hinted that drivers were being unfairly vic-
timized.

Matching payments
Only one of the departments we exam-
ined kept electronic payroll records that
matched pay with specific cases. For the
other departments, reporters pulled paper
files and read time slips.
I-team reporter Lisa Getter, using
Microsoft Access, did much of the matching
of the overtime database with databases of
arrests and off-duty police overtime jobs. We
found officers in multiple places at the same
time. One year, there were 85 cases of officers
who were in court for less than 10 minutes
but still received the union-specified mini-
mum of three hours overtime pay.
To detail how officers "piggybacked" onto
cases, we built a supplemental database for one
subset of cases. Using paper records, the report-
ers identified exactly which officers performed
which tasks on each case. Using an Access front
end, reporters entered the case number or
defendant name. The data-entry form then
automatically put the officers' names into drop-
down boxes to fill in each task on a case. That
way reporters could point-and-click very quickly
and avoid typos.
The computer analysis was lengthy and
challenging. But it was rewarding. The larg-
est local police union, which was placing
blame elsewhere and claiming officers were
being victimized, never even attempted to
deny or contradict our findings. In police
memos before our series, the problem was
downplayed as isolated or exaggerated. The
data proved them wrong.

Ray Robinson attended the NICAR ad-

Not long ago, we all dreamed of the day
when everyone in our newsrooms would be
able to fire up Access or FoxPro, craft a simple
query and retrieve a vital nugget of informa-
tion on deadline.

Cold Fusion is one of a
growing class of
software products
known as "middleware."

Web browser, submits
them to a database,
places the results in
HTML and sends them
back to the browser.

Well, it's not going to happen, is it? It's
not that journalists can't learn these skills.
But unless they're using them every day, the
skills won't be there when they need them. If
we're really going to make the data easily
accessible to them, we need another solution.
That's where Cold Fusion comes in.
Cold Fusion is one of a growing class of
software products known as “middleware."
On a computer that's been set up as a Web
server, it takes queries submitted from a
user's Web browser, submits them to a data-
base, places the results in HTML and sends
them back to the browser.
The technical advantages of such a setup
are too numerous to list here, but a few are
worth mentioning:
• Reporters on deadline use Netscape or
Internet Explorer instead of Access or FoxPro
to retrieve data.
• All the heavy lifting is done on the Web
server, not the user's computer. So the person
using a 486 with 8 megs of RAM can query
a 500,000 record database. All they need is a
browser.
• Even Mac users can query the database
as long as they have a browser.
If you're comfortable with databases and
have a passing knowledge of HTML, you can
use Cold Fusion.
The software operates from "templates,"
which are HTML-like pages with bits and
pieces of CFML (Cold Fusion Markup Lan-
guage) embedded in them. To put it simply,
the HTML controls the formatting and style
of the page the user sees. The CFML dictates
what is retrieved from the database and how
it's displayed.

Script studies
As an example, let's say you have a data-
base of names and addresses you want to put
on the Web. And rather than putting each
record into HTML and displaying it, you
want to let users query the database for indi-
vidual names.
The following code would create a text
box where the user could enter a person's last
name:
<FORM ACTION="RESULTS.CFM"
METHOD="POST">
<b>Enter last name here:</b>
<INPUT TYPE="text"
NAME="Last_name" SIZE="50"
MAXLENGTH="40">
<INPUT TYPE="submit"
value="submit"></CENTER></FORM>

When the user submits a last name, the
Web server kicks off the Cold Fusion script
("RESULTS.CFM"), which processes the
query and returns the information.
Cold Fusion takes the information off the
form and runs the query, with the following
code from "RESULTS.CFM":
<CFQUERY NAME="GetResults"
DATASOURCE="MYDATABASE">
SELECT * FROM NAMELIST WHERE NAME
= #Last_Name# order by Name
</CFQUERY>

Enhanced access
The query is actually processed by a snip-
pet of computer code called the ODBC (Open
Database Connectivity) driver. The results
are passed back to Cold Fusion, which sticks
them into HTML pages that the server sends
back over the network to the user.
That part of the script looks like this:
<CFTABLE QUERY="GetResults">
<CFCOL HEADER="Name" WIDTH="20"
TEXT=" #Name#">
<CECOL HEADER-"Address" WIDTH="30"
TEXT="#Address#"></CFTABLE>

"GetResults" is the name of the query that
has just run. The Name and Address inside
the pound signs are references to fields in the
database table. Users, viewing the results
with a browser, would see something like
this:
Name
BOYER
ROBINSON
Address
3022 NW 66th
P.O. Box 449

Like many other Web middleware prod-
ucts, Cold Fusion talks to databases through
ODBC, a database query standard. That's
good. ODBC drivers can access a variety of
data formats on a local machine, including
Access, dBase/FoxPro, Excel and Paradox.
ODBC drivers can also access higher end
client-server databases such as Microsoft SQL
Server, Oracle or IBM's DB2.
The bad news is that the speed and quality
of the drivers varies greatly. Older Access
"Jet" drivers can be slow and prone to crash,
for example. The Visual FoxPro driver you
can download from Microsoft is much faster
than the FoxPro driver that generally comes
with ODBC packages.

Enabling middleware
So what do you need in the way of hard-
ware to put Cold Fusion to work?
You need a Web server. But that doesn't
necessarily mean a monster machine with
128 megs of RAM and an 8-gigabyte drive.
In fact, a Web server is nothing more than
a PC with Web server software - such as
Website or Microsoft Internet Information
Server - installed on it.
If you want to start out small, you can
probably get away with setting up one of the
better PCs on your network as a Web server.
At The Virginian-Pilot, we test Web data-
base applications on a Pentium 200 with 32
megs of RAM. The setup has so far worked
fine, even with more than one user accessing
the data at the same time.
After testing, we move the applications to
a bigger server maintained by our online
edition for two reasons: (1) It gets them
outside the corporate fire wall where our
bureaus, which still access the Web through
dial-up connections, can get to the data; and
(2) It allows us to offer the general public
access to some of the data.
But for those considerations, we could
probably get by just fine running them on a
makeshift Web server in our newsroom.
Keep in mind, though, that more RAM is
always better. And with 32 megs of RAM
now selling for about $50, don't short your
machine on memory unless you have to.
Extra RAM also saves wear and tear on more
expensive hard drives.
And give your server the best hard drive
you can afford. It will dramatically increase
performance. Look into an Ultra Wide SCSI
hard drive running at a high RPM (7,200 to
10,000). Probably the best available for Web
servers right now is the Seagate Cheetah
series.
When you begin to develop Web database
applications, you'll find yourself confronted
with a lot of products with exotic - and
baffling
names like Active Server Pages,
Visual Interdev, Cold Fusion and countless
others.
Some Web site building software, such as
Microsoft Front Page 98, comes with tools
for building dynamic applications via ODBC
connections to databases.
The growing list of products makes for a
pretty confusing picture. We can't say that
Cold Fusion is the best solution, but we can
say that it has worked well for us at The
Virginian-Pilot and The Seattle Times.
You can waste a lot of time searching for
the perfect product. Or you can pick one that
you're comfortable with, learn it, stick with it
and get your data on the Web. That's what
we did with Cold Fusion.

Data Library Additions
NICAR's database library has recently added two data-
bases to its collection. The IRS Business Master File data-
base contains a listing of exempt organizations. Some fields
include the organization name, address, exempt classifica-
tion category, primary function of the organization, asset
amount and income amount.
As well, the library has acquired the 1996 FBI Uniform
Crime Report databases: six separate databases gathered
from law enforcement agencies around the country. They
are arranged by reporting agency and broken down by
month. The library can be reached at (573) 884-7332.

Campaign Finance Information Center
Campaign finance data from thirteen states is freely
downloadable from the CFIC at www.campaignfinance.org.
We also have links to ten online search engines hosted by
other non-profits and state boards of election. We will soon
release our "universal" online search engine so you can type
in a contributor from your state and see where else they are
giving.
The more inclusive this database, the better for every-
one. So if you have state or local campaign data you want
included, contact CFIC Coordinator Jack Dolan at
jack@nicar.org or (573) 882-1982. The CFIC credits ev-
eryone who contributes data.
