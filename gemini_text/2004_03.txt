LAW ENFORCEMENT
Finding
'missing'
kids
By Marc Chase,
The Times (Munster, Ind.)
At first glance, the Indiana Miss-
ing Children Clearinghouse list
showed that our circulation area
led the state in the number of
children reported missing by
law enforcement agencies. The
list also held the potential for a
number of compelling stories
about children who had been
listed as missing for several
years. But, as we tried to track
down those compelling stories,
we found the real story sur-
passed our initial impressions.
We found that at least 16 chil-
dren, or 10 percent of those
listed as missing from our re-
gion, were not missing at all.
And the city of Hammond likely
had more children on the state's
list than Indianapolis, which is
larger, because Hammond de-
tectives had failed to follow up
with parents in those cases.
What began as an attempt to
turn around a quick computer-
assisted reporting project led to
a three-month investigation that
revealed serious flaws in a

SPOTLIGHT: EMERGENCY RESPONSE
Survey helps explain
heart attack survival
By Robert Davis, USA Today
In the early 1990s, a discrepancy be-
tween big city survival rates for cardiac
arrest cases began to come into focus
in medical journals - some cities saved
10 times more victims than others.
As a back-burner issue project that I
pursued amid daily stories, I began look-
ing for ways to detail those differences.
Whenever I spoke with an emergency
room physician, fire department official
or cardiology researcher for a story, I
asked them about the discrepancies.
I began to see that the officials ex-
plained away the differences with rea-
sons they usually said were out of

PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
Making the connection
between doctors, ODS
By Fred Schulte, South Florida Sun-Sentinel
In the recent newspaper series "Drug-
ging the Poor," I tried to expose not only
the human tragedy of prescription drug
abuse, but also the huge financial cost.
The series revealed that a small
group of Florida doctors have pre-
scribed large quantities of narcotic
painkillers and other addictive drugs
to low-income people on Medicaid,
costing taxpayers hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars and adding to a tor-
rent of overdose deaths in the state.
The project linked some of the state's
top prescribing Medicaid doctors to
overdose deaths or histories of pro-
fessional misconduct. It also uncov-
ered millions of dollars in suspect bill-
ings for drugs, including claims gen-
erated using the license numbers of
doctors who were dead or otherwise
ineligible to write prescriptions.

from paper records readily available
to the public and others from data

Tangled webs
IRE and NICAR are beginning
to more deeply explore social
network analysis for visualizing
and diagramming relationships
between individuals, busi-
nesses and institutions. It's a
new approach for journalists,
but business consultants, law
enforcement agencies and pub-
lic health investigators have
used this approach for decades.
In 2003, The Washington Post
used social network analysis to
report on a group of Los Ange-
les-area language schools that
appeared to be "visa mills" for for-
eign students. For more informa-

INSIDE NICAR
Getting set for
election coverage
By David Herzog, NICAR and Missouri School of Journalism
This is a big year for election news,
with the U.S. House, Senate and presi-
dential races going full force. Oppor-
tunities abound for using computer-as-
sisted reporting.
If you're new to CAR the elections are a
great time to sink your teeth into cam-
paign finance data and see where the
candidates draw their financial support.
If you've been doing CAR for a long time,
there are plenty of compelling stories
that look deeper into campaign finance,
voter histories and election results.
Starting with this issue of Uplink, we'll
offer articles that will help you cover
elections and politics throughout the
election season. Check out page 3 for
an account of how Robert David
Sullivan of CommonWealth magazine
in Boston created a map of distinct
U.S. political areas. We'll have even
more in the May-June Uplink.
As the campaign unfolds, go online to
IRE's Campaign Finance Information
Center at www.campaignfinance.org
for resources, data and links to stories.
If you want to get a jump start on your
elections and politics coverage, you'll
want to get "Unstacking the Deck: A
Reporter's Guide to Campaign Fi-
nance," an IRE Beat Book by veteran
journalists Michael A. Weber, Aron
Pilhofer and Derek Willis.
For more information about the book visit

You can also sit in on campaign finance
panels and get hands-on CAR training
June 17-20 at the IRE Annual Conference
in Atlanta. Keep an eye on www.ire.org/

Upcoming hands-on
CAR training
IRE and NICAR have several train-
ing opportunities for journalists
seeking hands-on instruction in
using computer-assisted reporting.
There are two weeklong CAR boot
camps in Columbia, Mo., for jour-
nalists who want to learn how to
acquire electronic information, use
spreadsheets and databases to ana-
lyze the information and to translate
that information into high-impact sto-
ries. IRE and NICAR provide follow-
up help after participants return to
their news organizations. The boot
camps are May 16-21 and Aug. 1-6.
Editors can take advantage of an
abbreviated version of the boot
camp April 23-25 in Columbia, Mo.
Participants will learn how to make
CAR successful in their newsrooms
and will get just enough hands-on
experience to understand what
their reporters are tackling and en-
vision what is possible with CAR.
Hands-on classes will be offered at
the IRE Annual Conference June
17-20 in Atlanta. Those registering
for the classes will be able to learn
how to use spreadsheets and da-
tabase managers to analyze data.

ELECTIONS
Mapping a new look
at presidential results
By Robert David Sullivan, CommonWealth
"Beyond Red & Blue,” an exclusive re-
port on Common Wealth magazine's
Web site, takes a fresh look at presi-
dential elections by identifying 10 dis-
tinct political regions that cross state
boundaries. Drawing the new politi-
cal map of the U.S. required elections
and Census data, mapping and
spreadsheet analysis and some judg-
ment calls.
The project evolved from "The Lay of
the Land," a story about the political
regions of Massachusetts. That story,
by comparison, was a no-frills affair.
I typed election results for all of the
351 cities and towns in Massachu-
setts into Microsoft Excel, and then
assigned each city and town to one
of 10 regions with almost equal vot-
ing strength.
For "Beyond Red & Blue,” I did the
same for the 3,117 counties in the
United States and used ESRI
ArcView 3.3 geographic information
system (GIS) to create detailed col-
ored maps that later were turned into
graphics for the report on our Web
site. (See www.massinc.org/com-
monwealth/new_map_exclusive/
beyond_red_blue.html).

Data into Excel
As I built an Excel master data file with
the names of the U.S. counties I added
elections data collected from Web sites
and printed sources. In each state, the
Secretary of State's office or which-
ever agency oversees voting – posts
this information on the Internet. In
many cases you can download or cut
and paste data directly into Excel. (See
www.politics1.com/states.htm for links
to all 50 states.)
Other great sources of data are Dave
Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elec-
March • April 2004
tions (www.uselectionatlas.org) and
the "America at the Polls" books ed-
ited by Richard M. Scammon.
The first column of the spreadsheet
listed the county and state like this:
"Jefferson, AL,” “Jefferson, AR," to dis-
tinguish between counties having the
same name in different states.
In the adjacent columns, I entered how
each county voted in every presiden-
tial election since 1976. (This was not
as time-consuming as it sounds. I of-
ten used Excel's "fill handle" to mark
all the counties in a state as Demo-
cratic or Republican, then went back
and noted the exceptions, which were
usually few.)
I then sorted the results and used for-
matting tools to color the counties ac-
cording to which party carried them in
the close presidential elections of 1976
and 2000. I ended up with four catego-
ries: Democratic both times (blue),
Republican both times (red), Demo-
cratic then Republican (yellow), and
Republican then Democratic (green).
That was a good starting point, and I
used it to get a preliminary picture of
the 10 regions. I added another col-
umn to the spreadsheet and assigned
each county to one of the 10 regions,
basing the decision not only on the
voting history but also on the results
of certain state elections, and geo-
graphic factors.
To come up with 10 regions that had
an equal numbers of voters (as far as
that was possible), I added another
column to the spreadsheet that in-
cluded the total number of votes cast
in each county during 2000.
Using Excel, I was able to automati-
cally add up all the votes cast in every
Uplink
county labeled as being part of, for
example, the Appalachia region that I
had defined. That way, whenever I re-
assigned a county from one region to
another, I immediately saw how the
change affected the totals for both re-
gions. By keeping an eye on which re-
gions were significantly larger or
smaller than 10 percent of the elector-
ate, I was able to keep redrawing the
boundaries so that none of them got
too large or small.
At this point, I got greedy for more data.
I wanted to use demographic factors
to further refine the 10 regions. So I
created separate Excel spreadsheets
for criteria such as age, family income,
and population growth. I downloaded
county-level data for all of these fac-
tors from the U.S. Census Web site
(www.census.gov).

Smart linking
I also linked all of these new spread-
sheets to my original spreadsheet
through the VLOOKUP function.
Thus, each row of data in my Census
spreadsheets included a county
name and state, and I told Excel to
find the equivalent county name and
state in my master data file, then plug
in the right region names in the new
spreadsheet.
As in the master data file, I used the
SUMIF function - and simple calcula-
tion formulas - to get raw Census num-
bers and percentages for each region.
Because all the spreadsheets were
linked to the master data file I only had
to reassign a county from one region
to another on my original spreadsheet
to change all the spreadsheets.
If I looked at the spreadsheet for edu-
cational attainment and discovered that
the demographics in an Appalachian
county more closely matched the Farm
Belt region, I would change the
county's designation in the master data
file, and it would automatically change
in all the other Excel files, producing
new regional totals in each of them.
Because of this system I didn't have to
make any final decisions as to which
counties were in which regions until the

Baby dentistry
The IRE and NICAR Database
Library worked with WCNC-
Charlotte, N.C. to analyze Med-
icaid data for a story that aired
in December. The Database Li-
brary transferred tapes of Med-
icaid billing records to Microsoft
Access and FoxPro and identi-
fied pediatric dentists spending
millions of dollars of taxpayer
money on unneeded root ca-
nals in babies. The analysis
found that the main metropoli-
tan Medicaid centers in North
Carolina treated fewer than 10
percent of the kids on Medicaid
in the state, but performed al-
most half of the baby root ca-
nals. To view the story, go to

FIRST VENTURE
Principals cash in
on sick pay
By Art Golab, Chicago Sun-Times
Elementary school principal Anthony
Forst Jr. was rarely, if ever, sick in his
35-year career with the Chicago Pub-
lic Schools.
But he collected $129,000 in sick pay
his last year, bringing his total salary
to $247,000 - significantly more than
the mayor or governor makes. And it
was all legal.
That $247,000 figure appeared on the
top of one of the first sorts of teacher
salary data Sun-Times education re-
porter Rosalind Rossi and I received
from the state.
It led us to a story detailing how, under
a little-known provision in their contract,
Chicago teachers and principals can
collect up to 315 days of unused sick
pay in their last year of service, a prac-
tice unheard of in private industry.
We also found that 244 of those sick
days could be added to their service
time for pension purposes, a double-
dip that was unheard of even in gov-
ernment. As a result, principals could
get bigger pensions.
Rossi and I were relatively new to this
sort of thing, as our paper had just lost
both of our computer-assisted report-
ing specialists and decided to huri us
into the breach.
Fortunately, the paper sent us to an IRE
and NICAR Boot Camp where we learned
the tricks of the CAR trade. We were
much better prepared to tackle the story
than if we had tried to teach ourselves.
As a warm-up, we did the annual school
report card, which involved mostly im-
porting school test score data into
Microsoft Access and formatting it for a
special section. It was mind-numbing
work, importing and boiling down 11,000
columns of data for 3,900 schools. But it
helped hone our CAR skills.
We had to learn to select and import large
chunks of delimited text files and make
sure we assigned the correct heading to
each column of data. Then we found
ways to check its accuracy. We also
learned to link the tables we had gener-
ated to tables that had been created by
another reporter the year before.
We ran queries that calculated the dif-
ference in school scores between the
years for several grade levels in sev-
eral subjects.
In the course of all this work and while
we were going back and forth with the
State Board of Education on discrep-
ancies in the data (the boot camp had
prepared us well to expect this), Rossi
thought to ask them if the latest teacher
salary data was available.
It was, and it arrived on a CD by cou-
rier the next day, free of charge. When
we finished the report card, we felt
ready for anything, and decided to
tackle the teacher salary data, which
was technically a lot simpler.
Now the challenge was to get some-
thing interesting out of this data con-
taining 159,000 records of the salaries
of every teacher and school adminis-
trator in the state.
The teacher pay story had already
been done to death.
The previous year our paper had writ-
ten about the best-paid high school
teachers and what they did to earn
their salaries.
A Sun-Times investigative reporter no
longer with the paper took it up a notch,
doing the definitive story on school

Response
times
fall short
By Enric Volante,
(Tucson) Arizona Daily Star
Manager Shawn Bell called for
medical help when a man collapsed
in a diabetic seizure one night at Lil

waited 10 minutes for help - even
though an ambulance station is one
minute down the road.

No wonder Bell's interest was
keen when I sat down at the steak
house bar the next day and
showed him a map that compared
how long ambulances took to re-
spond to emergencies in his neigh-
borhood and others.
Thousands of people peered at that
map a few days later. Last April the
Arizona Daily Star published "Res-
cue Roulette," a three-day series
that revealed that the Tucson Fire
Department ambulances failed
more than half the time to reach
emergencies within the eight-
minute goal recommended by a
national industry group.
The stories also showed how other
local ambulance operators often
missed the target. And many - in-
cluding the company that re-
sponded to the diabetic man in the
steak house operated under li-
censing requirements less stringent
than Tucson's.

Getting dispatch data
If you want to analyze EMS re-
sponse, you'll need to get the CAD,
or computer-aided dispatch, data-
base. CAD data typically includes
all the information found on tradi-
tional ambulance logs, such as
time dispatched and time arrived,
as well as information on the inci-
dent, patient, property and ve-
hicles that responded.
Our city serves as dispatcher for
the area's largest ambulance op-
erator, the Tucson Fire Depart-
ment, and for several fire districts
and private ambulance compa-
nies. I requested the city's data for
all agencies under the Arizona
Public Records Law.
Tucson officials balked. In addition
to patient names, they refused to
release addresses to which ambu-
lances responded, saying that
might identify patients. They cited
medical privacy concerns and the
new restrictions posed by the
Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996
(HIPAA). They also withheld all
medical data, such as whether the
call involved cardiac arrest or an
asthma attack.
My colleague Rhonda Bodfield
and I met with city officials to ne-
gotiate which fields of data should
be released.
We would have liked to follow the lead
of journalists at The Hartford (Conn.)
Courant, who joined a database of
EMS responses with a public data-
base of deaths to identify patients
who died after long waits for medical
aid. (For more information see "Car-
diac crapshoot" in the July/August
1999 Uplink.) But death certificates
6

==Start of OCR for page 7==
are not public in Arizona, despite a
fairly broad public-records law that
hasn't been tinkered with much since
territorial days.
So we gave up the address fields
on condition that the city substitute
plat numbers from a grid of quar-
ter-mile land sections. Unable to
argue that patients would be iden-
tified, the city then also gave up
the medical data for each ambu-
lance call.
Lacking names and addresses, we
found patients to interview the old-
fashioned way. We hit the court-
house to review civil lawsuits and
we asked sources in the EMS busi-
ness to name people who had
waited a long time for help.
The city provided the database re-
luctantly and slowly, but at no cost.
We ended up with a text file of
270,968 records of dispatch calls
over 18 months that included fires,
routine medical transports and
medical emergencies.
By querying in Microsoft Access we
found 92,400 were emergency am-
bulance calls. We deleted calls in
which an ambulance was diverted
to another scene. Sometimes in the
heat of an emergency, drivers sim-
ply forgot to record when they ar-
rived, so we also threw out calls with
imprecise arrival times. That left
89,818 records.
Then we tabulated how long it took
from the time an ambulance was dis-
patched to the time its crew reported
arriving at the scene. We flipped the
results into Excel to chart a compari-
son of the different agencies.
We mapped the calls in ArcView
using a quarter-mile grid layer
downloaded from the county trans-
portation department's Web site,
along with shapefiles of streets, fire
stations and subdivisions that
helped us see routes to the most
populated areas. We used
ArcView's legend editor to create a
color-graduated grid of response
times within each cell of the grid.
Slower response times on the
edges of the metropolitan area im-
mediately jumped out, particularly
in the northwest, where a once-ru-
ral fire district was coping with a
growth boom.
But, like many parts of the coun-
try where fire departments and pri-
vate ambulance companies have
fought for turf, the Tucson region
is a patchwork of competing pro-
viders. So we also asked the
county's largest ambulance opera-
tor outside the city for its CAD da-
tabase. Rural/Metro Corp. denied
the request. That lack of account-
ability to the public became part
of the story.
We knew the Arizona Department
of Health Services had paper logs
of ambulance calls submitted by
Rural/Metro as part of its three-year
license renewal. We ordered cop-
ies. Typing the data into Excel and
double-checking it took three days,
but it was worth it.
Unlike the city, the state had no
problem releasing the patient ad-
dresses in those logs. We used
ArcView's geocoding function to dis-
play about 7,500 addresses as
points on a street map from the
county transportation department.
As we queried the data in ArcView,
we saw long waits of 15 minutes or
more had occurred in many places,
not just distant areas. Dennis Joyce,
assistant managing editor for news,
had us run side-by-side maps show-
ing different wait times.
While Arizona doesn't release death
certificates, it was one of the first
states to make campaign finance
Uplink
records available by FTP download.
We found Arizona-based Rural/
Metro kicks off the legislative ses-
sion each year by spending close
to $20,000 on a bash for lawmak-
ers at places such as Phoenix's
Ritz-Carlton hotel. As one ex-legis-
lator told Bodfield, "I always graded
the party by the shrimp - and they
would have shrimp."
After we mapped the data, I visited
some neighborhoods with long re-
sponse times. I spoke to a few
people on the street and then
walked into Lil Abner's Steak
House. When a cook mentioned
that a man had been convulsing and
kicking tables the night before while
the manager phoned for an ambu-
lance, I knew I'd brought the map
to the right place.

SPOTLIGHT: EMERGENCY RESPONSE
Sprawl outpaces
private ambulances
By Jeff Sonderman, Missouri School of Journalism
Investigating emergency response times
takes a lot of upfront reporting and data
chasing before you know if you have a
story. So how do you know if you should
jump into doing this story in your com-
munity? There are a couple of ways.
If you notice specific cases where
people died waiting for an ambulance,
that's an obvious red flag. But you don't
need to wait for such a clear signal.
In any community with sprawl and
growth, journalists may wonder
whether key public services, including
emergency medical services (EMS),
are keeping up. That's what sparked
my interest and led to "A Matter of
Time," a November 2003 story in the
Columbia Missourian.
The story was based on the analysis
of Boone County computer-aided dis-
patch data using ESRI's ArcView 8.2,
as well as Microsoft Excel and Access.
I obtained three years of computer-aided
dispatch (CAD) records of emergency
medical calls, 39,744 total, from Public
Safety Joint Communications, a city
agency that operates the 911 service.
The agency's database manager was
cooperative and told me what data was
available. Because of privacy concerns
under the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA),
the agency would only release the data
to the hospitals, which then handed it to
me on CD. The data came in a comma-
delimited text format at no cost because
it required no special programming.
HIPAA also challenged our desire to
map response performance. The hos-
pitals refused to provide addresses
that were logged for each call because
the information could easily identify pa-
tients. I talked to the database man-
ager about alternatives, and he said the
dispatch agency logs the general lo-
cation of each call using a grid with cells
of about one-half square mile each. He
e-mailed me an ArcView shapefile of
the geographic grid system that day.
The response data was relatively clean;
911 system computers, not people, had
entered much of the data automatically.
The biggest problem was that response
times were not properly logged on
some calls. The response time is re-
corded when the dispatcher presses a
button at the time of dispatch and again
at the arrival on scene. In some cases,
the dispatcher missed one of those
events, and the response time was re-
corded as zero. These records were
excluded because the errors seemed
to affect calls in a random pattern that
did not skew the data. This anomaly,
as well as all of my analysis, was ex-
plained to the readers in a sidebar.
We imported and analyzed the data
into Access and exported the results
of some of the queries in Excel.
The analysis included looking at over-
all response time, as well as grouping
in Access to see response times by am-
bulance, specific location, city or town,
and time of day. I looked at the division
of call volume among various ambu-
lances and locations and times of day.
To analyze performance relative to the
eight-and six-minute response time stan-
dards of the hospitals, I created two fields
to indicate whether the unit had reached
the scene within each of those two time
frames. I also created new fields to dis-
play the response time for each call in
seconds, based upon the start and end
times included in the data.
In ArcView, I used the grid to map re-
sponses by grid section, which pro-
duced a color-coded mosaic showing
the percentage of calls in each sector
that were reached within the eight-
minute goal. To do this, I first used an
Access query to group by the coordi-
nates for each grid sector. I then
summed the number of calls reached
within the goal and counted the total
number of calls in the area. I imported
the result of that query into Excel to
figure out the percentage of success-
ful response times for each grid sec-
tor. Then I imported that simple table
just grid coordinates and the percent-
age of success - into ArcView and ap-
plied it to the shapefile that used the
same grid coordinates.
Talking to the people who kept the data
also helped us to extract useful data
from two of the fields in the database.
The grid coordinate field of each record
corresponded to a single cell on the
grid map, but it also contained a letter
at the end of the four or five numbers
(the "B" in section 14041B, for ex-
ample) that indicated the general lo-
cation of the call. Each of the smaller
cities and towns in the county had its
own assigned letter. I parsed the grid
coordinate field in Access and placed
its letter into a new field so I could eas-
ily examine all the calls in those towns
using grouping and counting queries.
The index field that assigns a unique
identifier to each dispatch also included
characters that indicate which ambu-
lance responded, for example "M31"
for Medic 31. We parsed those refer-
ences into a new field, which allowed
us to look at response times and emer-
gency call volume for each ambulance.
The two ambulance services that cover
Boone County are owned and oper-
ated by the two major local hospitals.
The good news for residents is that
they don't pay a tax for a public ambu-
lance service. But this also means the
ambulance services are departments
of large institutions that have to watch
their financial bottom lines.
Emergency medical services tend to
lose money, and that puts the opera-
8

tors in a sticky position. How much
money are they willing to lose on an
ambulance service to provide better
patient care?
This is an especially important issue
in small but rapidly growing regions,
such as Columbia and Boone County,
which has a population of about
135,000 people, with about two-thirds
of them in the city of Columbia. But
Columbia is sprawling outward, away
from the ambulance stations, and
populations are growing in other cities
around the county.
Once I had the story, it was time to
make it come alive with field reporting.
I went on several ambulance ride-
alongs, arranged by one of the hospi-
tals, and shadowed the paramedics
when they responded to calls.
This firsthand experience helped me
understand the system and the num-
bers I was writing about. It also gave
me extended access to paramedics in
their work environment, where they
were talkative and comfortable. The
time I spent on ride-alongs was incred-
ibly useful. The paramedics are on the
front lines of EMS, so they often pro-
vided the most insightful comments on
the data I showed them.
Paramedics can also help answer the
big question: How much is better pa-
tient care worth? Paramedics almost
always want more ambulances and
more resources. They would take an
ambulance on every street corner if
they could get it, because their biggest
concern is patient care. Here you might
find, if not a whistleblower, at least an
advocate for change in the system.
Contrast that with the concerns of man-
agers and hospital administrators.
Many of them have never worked as
paramedics, and their focus is more on
the financial costs of adding ambu-
lances or other resources.
So in most EMS systems, you will prob-
ably find some amount of tension be-
tween what the EMS workers want and
what the administrators think is nec-

essary or practical. Each side will be ea-
ger to convince you, and you can use
information from both sides to develop
a balanced story.

Here are some tips for using
computer-aided dispatch data for
analyzing EMS response from
Enric Volante of the (Tucson)
Arizona Daily Star.
• Don't rely on average or median
response times. They tend to
mislead. Compare the percentage
of ambulance runs that meet a set
time goal, such as 90 percent of
emergencies within eight minutes.
Use a shorter time for first
responders. Check the guidelines
of national firefighting groups for
different types of EMS calls.
• Pick your target. An increasing
number of fire departments send
fire trucks with paramedics or
emergency medical technicians
to stabilize a patient until an
ambulance arrives to take the
patient to a hospital. Are you
going to map runs by ambulances
or by first responders? Your
choice may depend on the level
of aid first responders are
equipped to give and how many
fire trucks in your city have them.
• Request only the data you need.
CAD databases can be big and
complex. Talk with the person
who knows the data and review
the record layout so you
understand each field before you
submit a request.
• Borrow a dispatcher's manual. It
explains the process for prioritizing
each emergency based upon the
medical symptoms reported to the
dispatcher.

closing days of the project. I could keep
tweaking the regions as I discovered
new data.
Mapping regions
I turned to ArcView late in the project,
and I did not use the mapping soft-
ware to make any new calculations. I
began by using a blank map that
showed boundaries for all of all the
counties in the United States, a map
that came with ArcView. That map
includes a data (or "attributes") file
that includes standardized codes
(known as FIPS codes) assigned to
each county.
I then added the FIPS codes to the
master data file, which I saved as a
dBASE file in order to import it into
ArcView. Using a method in ArcView
similar to Excel's VLOOKUP function,
I then linked the dBASE file to the at-
tributes file in such a way that all of
the counties were automatically as-
signed to the proper regions. Then I
created a legend that assigned a dif-
ferent color to each region, and I used
the "unique value" function to pro-
duce, with just a couple of keystrokes,
a map that resembles the final "Be-
yond Red & Blue" map.
I wasn't quite done, however, be-

The 10 Regions of US Politics
Our regions are based on voting retums from both national and state elections, demographic data from the US
Census, and certain geographic features such as mountain ranges and coastlines. Each region represents about
one-tenth of the national electorate, casting between 10.4 million and 10.8 million votes in the 2000
presidential election.

cause the ArcView map exposed cer-
tain aesthetic flaws, such as regions
with fingers and tentacles made up
of sparsely populated counties. I then
went back and made some final ad-
justments to the master data file,
making the regions look a bit more
coherent. I decided that those odd
shapes and extensions are justified
only when significant numbers of vot-
ers are involved. (For example, I
pushed the El Norte region up to in-
clude San Antonio's Bexar County be-
cause it's a major urban area with some
400,000 voters. I did not expand the
Big River region to include several
Democratic-leaning counties on the
Farm Belt
KENTUCKY
2003 Massachusetts Institute for a New Commonwealth
Upper Peninsula of Michigan because
they include too few voters to be much
of a factor in statewide elections.) Af-
ter I made these final corrections to the
master data file, I saved it as a dBASE
file and imported it into ArcView.
To create separate ArcView maps for
each region, I simply copied the na-
tional map 10 times. Each time, I
changed the legend so that only one
region appeared up in color, while the
other nine were left invisible. I also
imported other ArcView data files to
add state lines and major cities.
The project took a couple of months
while I worked on regular duties. The
finished product, posted on our Web
site in mid-December, includes close-
up maps for each region and a set of
tables showing the political and demo-
graphic characteristics for each.
Next comes what I consider to be the
fun part. When the results come in for
the 2004 election, I hope to redraw the
"Beyond Red & Blue" map to reflect any
changes in voting patterns. And all of
my old data will be automatically up-
dated to reflect these changes, with
very little effort on my part - leaving
more time for writing.

superintendent pay. He revealed that
top-paid superintendents were getting
retirement incentives that had the po-
tential to cripple the taxpayer-backed
state pension fund.
Our competition, the Chicago Tribune,
borrowed that angle and applied it to
elementary teachers.
So Rossi suggested we look at prin-
cipals.
Our data had the name, salary, posi-
tion and district information for all
school employees in the state, but the
state board had omitted the names of
their schools.
We asked them to provide another disk
with the school name information,
which they did, and forged on, running
simple queries for salaries of high
school, junior high and elementary
principals. To do that we selected the
codes used for each position, which
were provided in a separate text file
that also contained the record layout.
The top ten ranged from $179,000 to
$247,000, which was definitely very
interesting. But the question arose,
how do they make the money? Most
were at or close to retirement age. Was
it just another case of retirement incen-
tives inflating pay?
The raw numbers only gave us total
salaries.
We had to get the breakdowns the hard
way, by calling each district. We made
our jobs easier by focusing only on the
top ten salaries.
But the district superintendents and busi-
ness managers at first took advantage
of the fact that we didn't know which
questions to ask. They gladly broke out
retirement incentives because they could
make a case that this saved them money
by enabling them to hire less-experi-
enced, lower-paid replacements.
March • April 2004
But accumulated sick pay, vacation pay
and other benefits that we had no idea
existed all were lumped into one category.
Gradually, by comparing notes be-
tween districts, we learned to ask for
more specific breakdowns from every-
one and kept calling until we got them.
Getting the numbers
is sometimes
the easiest part of
the story.
As a result, the Microsoft Excel spread-
sheet we used to keep track of the
salary breakdowns kept growing wider.
Three facts quickly emerged. All of
these principals had retired, and in
many cases retirement incentives had
pushed them into the top pay brackets.
But only suburban principals got the
retirement incentives.
Chicago principals got a different go-
ing away present. They were allowed
to cash out nearly a year of sick days
and apply a large portion of those days
to their service time, thereby boosting
their pensions.
We still weren't sure this was a story.
To put it in perspective, we called school
districts in New York and Los Angeles.
After wading through their complex re-
tirement packages (nothing is simple in
educational bureaucracies) we learned
they were far less generous with accu-
mulated sick pay than Chicago.
And a compensation expert at the Illi-
nois Chamber of Commerce told us
such benefits were unheard of in pri-
vate industry.
So we finally had a story.
School and union officials defended the
system, saying it provides an incentive
Uplink
for teachers (who eventually become
principals) to show up every day and
thus saves money spent on substi-
tute teachers. It also rewards Chicago
teachers who stick it out until retire-
ment and don't make as much money
as suburban teachers.
And it serves as a de facto retire-
ment incentive, allowing quicker re-
placement of top-scale teachers and
principals with lower-paid beginners.
But other experts pointed out that
the Chicago teachers and principals
also get another perk, that few, if
any, in private industry get - a pen-
sion that pays 75 percent of their
base retirement salary.
This project confirmed what Rossi
and I had learned in the CAR boot
camp. Getting the numbers is some-
times the easiest part of the story.
Figuring out what they mean, putting
them in context and then bringing
those numbers to life is the hard part.

askSam tames
the data clutter
By Bonnie Britt, Freelance
I worked in a newsroom where a clut-
ter-averse assistant managing editor
periodically pushed a big trash bar-
rel through the aisles expecting re-
porters to toss documents. Packrats
like me did not share his enthusiasm
for a tidier newsroom.
Then I learned about askSam, an
archiving and free-form database
program that allows journalists to
squirrel away information electroni-
cally - instead of letting it pile up on
their desks. The program is a natural
friend to journalists, historians, archi-
vists, investigators, and packrats of
every stripe.
Using askSam is better than living
with paper clutter because nothing
gets lost or buried. And the program
does not force you to shoehorn data
into fields with set lengths. In fact, you
can choose whether or not to import
data into fields.

You can search, sort, and sift massive
amounts of data (up to 16 terabytes),
structured or unstructured, from an ar-
ray of formats. Its speed and flexibility
explain why askSam is popular among
intelligence and law enforcement
agencies whose personnel often think
and work like journalists.
Using it
The U.S. General Accounting Office
uses it with other software to collect
and organize survey information.
Senate investigators pursuing the
Iran-contra scandal employed
askSam's lightning speed to good ad-
vantage in the mid-1980's to ask in-
formed questions of Oliver North in
real time. The program enabled them
to organize, catalog and present the
volumes of evidence they had gath-
ered during their investigation and
subsequent Senate hearings.
A forensic document analyst at the
X
U.S. Postal Inspection Service built a
central repository in askSam of articles
relating to death threats sent through
the mail, forged signatures, counterfeit
passports and related topics.
While askSam is valuable to people who
toss unstructured notes into files, then
do simple or Boolean searches for com-
binations of words or phrases, it also of-
fers detailed reports based on field data
queries. For example, you can set
askSam to automatically recognize e-
mail fields such as, To, From and Sub-
ject, or you can import e-mail without
specifying any field. The database is
searchable either way, but if you import
e-mail with fields, you can ask for a re-
port on all e-mail, say, from Ken Lay be-
tween two dates when the subject con-
tains a particular word or phrase. You can
search dates, fields, proximity, or explore
numeric values and relationships, or do
a global search and replace.
You can search through multiple
askSam databases to keep track of
projects or to compare statements of
public officials over time. The program
is easy to use once you've figured out
what you want from it, and it's smart
enough to adapt for use with Microsoft
Access, Excel or LexisNexis.
Why would anyone want to import a
spreadsheet into askSam? To more
easily view and page through rows; to
view it differently so as to spot errors;
or to query it differently. Viewing a long
row of data in Excel is easier to read
when laid out on one page. Each suc-
ceeding row can be viewed, page by
page, by pressing F9 for next (or ALT-
F9 for previous.)
Stories captured from LexisNexis can
be searched in a variety of ways, such
as for combinations of names, along-
side Web pages, stories cut and pasted
from today's news, annotated screen
shots, and other tidbits gathered and
thrown into the mix.
The search results are displayed in a
split window that is easy to navigate.

data. Click on any row to see the en-
tire corresponding document.
Getting started
To begin using askSam, you open an
empty database, name it and save it.
You can immediately begin building a
database in any of four ways:
• Drop documents into askSam by cut-
ting and pasting them as plain text or,
using the "paste special" option, as
HTML or rich text. (You add graphics
separately.)
• Import all or some documents, one
file type at a time, from a Windows
folder. You can opt to import e-mail at-
tachments.
• Link any file in its native format.
Linked files retain their formats and
can be opened in askSam and edited.
• Attach a file in any format. An at-
tached file becomes a part of the
askSam database.
You can customize askSam data-
bases using fonts, colors and other
formatting. HTML and rich text docu-
ments will retain the formatting of the
original files; text documents will re-
flect your choices.
You can also customize each database
to control how dates are displayed and
what search results are shown.
The biggest complaint of longtime
askSam users is that table columns
in HTML and Word do not align prop-
erly. Users have found a work-
around: pasting table text into
askSam to facilitate searching, and
then attaching the original document
to the database so it can be viewed
with columnar data properly aligned.
The ability to share askSam data-
bases with colleagues is a new fea-
ture. Last year, the company, based
in Perry, Fla., began offering a free
viewer, which is similar in function to
the Adobe Acrobat Reader. Col-
leagues can use the free viewer to
read and search - but not add to, or
March • April 2004
modify - existing databases.
The standard askSam program retails
for $149 and is powerful enough for
importing e-mail, or keeping track of
the elements of a nonfiction book or
news project. For power users who
want more speed and flexibility, there
is a professional version, which in-
cludes full-text indexing, for $395 re-
tail. Indexing speeds searches of big
databases. askSam Professional also
includes an ActiveX control that can
be accessed from Visual Basic and
other programming languages to cre-
ate customized applications.
The program's features include a tool
to pack databases to keep them lean.
The program also allows document
deletion and creation, and remembers
which documents and searches you've
marked for recall.
For more about the program, visit
www.asksam.com, where you can also
download a 30-day evaluation version.

Xandros: Switching
from Windows
By Aron Pilhofer, Center for Public Integrity
Mydoom was the last straw.
It was Tuesday, Jan. 27, just past 9 p.m.
I was staring at dozens of Microsoft Out-
look e-mail messages infected with cop-
ies of the Mydoom virus, trying to figure
out how, despite security precautions
bordering on paranoia, one of those little
buggers had managed to infect my Win-
dows XP system.
I was firewalled and patched. My virus
software was up to date. I had never
used the Outlook preview pane, read
suspect messages or opened unknown
attachments. Yet, I had the virus.
It was then and there that I decided I
was done with Windows. I was going
to make the switch to Linux as my main
desktop once and for all.
I have been working with Linux for years
now - first as a newsroom intranet and
data server, and then as a secondary
operating system on my home computer.
But even though I had adopted open
source software for much of my CAR-
related work, I never did make the per-
manent switch to a Linux desktop.
A few years ago, I was close to the
brink of sanity trying to deal with yet
another utterly inexplicable Windows
ME crash and burn. But then Microsoft
released the truly excellent Windows
XP, which was fast, easy and (most
importantly) stable.
Windows XP, however, isn't secure and
I'm tired of having to hold my breath
every time I hit the "send/receive" but-
ton in Outlook. A properly maintained
Linux box, on the other hand, is just as
stable as XP and virtually immune to
the kinds of attacks plaguing Windows
users. I have considered other options,
such as Apple OS X (which is based
on a core operating system similar to
Linux). But even though I love the soft-
ware, I am not willing to pay a premium
for new hardware.
Thus, my transition to Linux began.
Which distribution?
There are literally thousands of ver-
sions of Linux, some are well known
but most are fairly obscure. Some are
produced by corporations, such as
Mandrake, SUSE or Red Hat. Others,
such as Debian, Slackware or Gentoo,
are designed by enthusiasts as a la-
bor of love.
Xandros lives up
to its promise and
then some.
I had experimented over the years with
most of the versions I've mentioned,
so I was pretty familiar with their re-
spective strengths and weaknesses.
Because I was going to be using Linux
for both home and work, I had some
fairly specific criteria in mind. I needed
a distribution that is:
• Easy to administer and maintain
• Able to run a wide range of software,
both open source and proprietary
• Well-documented and well-maintained
My first choice was Red Hat (See a re-
view in the September/October 2003
Uplink), but the company recently de-
cided to focus on corporate desktops,
and handed over development of its
desktop distribution (now called Fe-
dora) to volunteers.
I tried Fedora, but the installation froze
not a good sign. I then read about a
distribution called Xandros, which was
designed to appeal to former Windows
users. The deluxe version even comes
packaged with software that allows
users to install and use Microsoft Of-
fice and other Windows applications.
Best yet, Xandros is based on the
Debian version of Linux, one of the old-
est, most respected and reliable ver-
sions available. It also features a slick
software management tool called apt.
I paid $89 for the deluxe version and
downloaded the installation discs and
documentation. A few hours later, I was
on my way.
Installation
Xandros has one of the smoothest in-
stallations available. Xandros recog-
nized nearly all my computer hardware
during the installation - something that
was a first in all my previous operating
system installations.
I wanted to add Xandros while preserv-
ing both my existing Windows installa-
tion and another version of Linux I had
already put on the machine. I also had
just added some fairly cutting edge
hardware, which can cause installation
problems for any operating system, but
especially Linux.
To my surprise and delight, Xandros
handled my hardware without a hiccup.
My New Home
Booting Xandros for the first time re-
vealed a Linux environment that has
been tweaked as much as possible to
look and feel like Windows. Double
clicking opens a directory or launches
a program. Xandros automatically
loads additional hard drives or parti-
tions - including Windows partitions
into a top-level directory named "disks."
Xandros goes to great lengths to hide
its Linux underpinnings. When boot-
ing into or shutting down from
Xandros, you see a graphic, and not
the typical stream of gobbledy-gook
messages Linux usually spews onto
the screen.

==Start of OCR for page 15==
The last, and biggest, difference in
the Xandros deluxe version is the in-
clusion of Crossover Office, which is
a set of utilities that trick Windows ap-
plications into running under Linux.
They are optimized, as the name sug-
gests, to work best with Microsoft
Office, and my copies of Microsoft
Access, Excel and PowerPoint 2000
installed flawlessly.
One criticism of
the desktop is that
it does not look as
smooth, crisp and
clean as Red Hat
or Windows XP.
In very limited testing, I can report
that all three seem to work nearly as
well under Linux as they do under
Windows. The only obvious differ-
ences are aesthetic. Menus seem a
little darker under Linux, and the
menu fonts seem smaller.
One criticism of the desktop is that it
does not look as smooth, crisp and
clean as Red Hat or Windows XP.
Fonts can appear blocky, but that is a
minor gripe.
Simplicity
In terms of software management,
Xandros is outstanding. The distribu-
tion has a very simple, but powerful,
package manager. It can be used to
install updates from the Xandros Web
site, or add new software from any
number of sources, including stan-
dard Debian repositories on the
Internet. Think of it as the Windows
Update and Add/Remove Software
utilities all in one.
The manager operates in simple and
expert modes. In simple mode, users
can install only the software that has
been packaged for the Xandros in-
March • April 2004
stallation as well as any security or
software updates the company
makes available on its Web site. This
is probably more than enough for
most users, but there are a few soft-
ware packages (PostgreSQL,
Webmin) that were excluded from the
standard installation.
Switching into expert mode provides
access to software stored in reposito-
ries across the Internet, and the ability
to add more of your own.
Installing an application is usually a
simple matter of a single mouse click.
Not only does Xandros download the
application, but also it automatically
handles the problem of figuring out what
other programs or libraries are required
and downloading those as well.
Most of the popular Linux distributions
use a package management system
based on one developed by Red Hat
a few years ago (the Red Hat Pack-
age Management system, or RPM).
RPM, to be blunt, stinks. Installing ap-
plications other than those packaged
with the distribution under RPM can be
a long, frustrating, and often-fruitless
experience.
Xandros's apt-based package man-
ager is amazing. I cherry-picked more
than a dozen non-standard applica-
tions a recipe for disaster for RPM-
based distributions. Xandros dutifully
and flawlessly installed each one with-
out a hitch. That is impressive.
Final Thoughts
Xandros lives up to its promise and
then some. It is Linux for those who
want to wade rather than dive into a
new operating system.
Some Linux purists will not like the
modifications Xandros has made. But
for folks who don't come from a Unix
background, and don't have a com-
puter science degree, Xandros is just
possibly the best of both worlds.

Drugs

made public for the first time, provided
key information for the reporting.
First, the paper records.
I obtained nearly 3,000 drug over-
dose autopsy case files, most of
them from 2001 and 2002, from
Florida's 24 medical examiner dis-
tricts. I examined each file, looking
for the name of the treating physician
of the deceased. Some files con-
tained "medication inventory" sheets,
which logged all of the pills found at
the death scene with the name of the
doctor, drug, the pharmacy that filled
the prescription and the date filled,
but others didn't.
I typed the names of victims, doctors
and drugs into a Microsoft Access da-
tabase on my laptop. It was often as
frustrating as it was time consuming.
In many cases, pills were found at
the death scene in bottles, but no-
body recorded the name of the doc-
tor who had prescribed them, for in-
stance.
After visiting morgues for several
months my death file grew and a pat-
tern emerged: each examiner's dis-
trict had a handful of doctors with ab-
normally high numbers of deaths that
had gone unnoticed.
I wound up with more than 40 doc-
tors with four or more patient deaths
for 2001 and 2002. Sixteen doctors
had prescribed pills found at the
scenes of eight deaths or more,
mostly in that same two-year period.
Some had deaths spanning several
medical examiner districts.
Nobody had done this type of re-
search before, even though state
medical licensing officials believe a
pattern of overdose deaths in a
doctor's medical practice warrants
investigation. Nor had anyone
matched doctors with high numbers
of patient deaths against Medicaid
prescription drug billing data. I got
the chance to do that after Florida At-
torney General Charlie Crist agreed
to make the billing records public at
no cost.
After some negotiation, Medicaid
fraud unit investigators sent me a
Microsoft Access database on CD-
ROM. It contained data for 8.8 mil-
lion Medicaid pharmacy claims, which
amounted to more than $346 million
in drug billings for 2000-2002.
The database contains two tables, one
that was 1.49 GB, the other slightly
smaller. The data included sales of all
"controlled" drugs - 844 varieties of
narcotics and other medications. Each
drug has a five-character code that
serves as a unique identifier. The drugs
range from brand name painkillers like
OxyContin that cost Medicaid more
than $7 a pill to generic tranquilizers
and sleeping pills that cost just pen-
nies per dose.
I spent many hours
rummaging through
this huge data set.
The database contains fields for the
name of the prescribing doctor, license
number of doctor, year of the prescrip-
tion, county of the doctor, amount paid,
number of Medicaid recipients treated
and the pharmacy that billed for the
drugs.
Initial queries using Access showed
fewer than 3 percent of the state's
doctors were prescribing two-
thirds of the narcotics dispensed to
people on Medicaid. Five doctors had
prescribed $2 million or more worth
of narcotics over three years, much
of it OxyContin.
I spent many hours rummaging
through this huge data set, doing
queries and sorting results to find
other patterns. Scrolling through, I
spotted the name of a doctor I knew

Tech tip...
Curl-ing apart Web documents
By Derek Willis, Center for Public Integrity
Here's a pet peeve you might rec-
ognize: you find a database you
need on the Web, but can't down-
load it with a single click. Instead,
the records are contained on sepa-
rate pages, sometimes behind a
search form that lets you see only a
few entries at a time. Hitting Con-
trol-S several hundred times isn't
my idea of a great day.
But there's good news: there are
tools that can pry loose all that data
without much trouble or effort on
your part. My favorite is curl, a com-
mand-line utility for Windows, Unix,
Command Prompt
Linux and Mac OS X. With curl, I can
download batches of files with a con-
sistent naming pattern, such as those
pesky.ASP or .CGI files that contain
numbers in the URL string.
Curl is a free command-line utility,
meaning that you run it from the ter-
minal in Linux, Unix or Mac OS X,
or from the DOS prompt in Win-
dows. If your system doesn't have
curl installed, you can get it from
http://curl.haxx.se. Be sure to book-
mark curl's basic documentation
(http://curl.sourceforge.net/docs/
manpage.html); it comes in handy.

Here's an example of using curl: a
few months ago, Jeff South, a Vir-
ginia Commonwealth University
professor and former database
editor at the Austin American-
Statesman, posted to the NICAR-
L listserv asking if anyone had an
easier way to put together a list of
California lobbyists.
The official state Web site (http://cal-
access.ss.ca.gov/Lobbying) has a
list of current lobbyists but only
shows one page for each letter of
the alphabet, meaning that you'd
have to save each one and then put
them together before beginning the
task of separating the records from
the HTML around them.
Curl was built for just this kind of
task, since it offers powerful ways
to automate downloads based on
a consistent pattern. The URL for
lobbyists with a last name begin-
ning with "A" is http://cal-
access.ss.ca.gov/Lobbying/Lob-
byists/list.aspx?letter A, and the
only character that changes from
one file to the next is the final capi-
tal letter.
Curl has the ability to iterate through
a range of letters or numbers, so I
wrote the following command:
Curl "http://cal-
access.ss.ca.gov/Lobbying/
Lobbyists/list.aspx?letter=[A-
21" o "lobby_#1.txt"
This command tells curl to begin
with the initial URL ending in A,
download each one, and save it to

superintendent pay. He revealed that
top-paid superintendents were getting
retirement incentives that had the po-
tential to cripple the taxpayer-backed
state pension fund.
Our competition, the Chicago Tribune,
borrowed that angle and applied it to
elementary teachers.
So Rossi suggested we look at prin-
cipals.
Our data had the name, salary, posi-
tion and district information for all
school employees in the state, but the
state board had omitted the names of
their schools.
We asked them to provide another disk
with the school name information,
which they did, and forged on, running
simple queries for salaries of high
school, junior high and elementary
principals. To do that we selected the
codes used for each position, which
were provided in a separate text file
that also contained the record layout.
The top ten ranged from $179,000 to
$247,000, which was definitely very
interesting. But the question arose,
how do they make the money? Most
were at or close to retirement age. Was
it just another case of retirement incen-
tives inflating pay?
The raw numbers only gave us total
salaries.
We had to get the breakdowns the hard
way, by calling each district. We made
our jobs easier by focusing only on the
top ten salaries.
But the district superintendents and busi-
ness managers at first took advantage
of the fact that we didn't know which
questions to ask. They gladly broke out
retirement incentives because they could
make a case that this saved them money
by enabling them to hire less-experi-
enced, lower-paid replacements.
March • April 2004
But accumulated sick pay, vacation pay
and other benefits that we had no idea
existed all were lumped into one category.
Gradually, by comparing notes be-
tween districts, we learned to ask for
more specific breakdowns from every-
one and kept calling until we got them.
Getting the numbers
is sometimes
the easiest part of
the story.
As a result, the Microsoft Excel spread-
sheet we used to keep track of the
salary breakdowns kept growing wider.
Three facts quickly emerged. All of
these principals had retired, and in
many cases retirement incentives had
pushed them into the top pay brackets.
But only suburban principals got the
retirement incentives.
Chicago principals got a different go-
ing away present. They were allowed
to cash out nearly a year of sick days
and apply a large portion of those days
to their service time, thereby boosting
their pensions.
We still weren't sure this was a story.
To put it in perspective, we called school
districts in New York and Los Angeles.
After wading through their complex re-
tirement packages (nothing is simple in
educational bureaucracies) we learned
they were far less generous with accu-
mulated sick pay than Chicago.
And a compensation expert at the Illi-
nois Chamber of Commerce told us
such benefits were unheard of in pri-
vate industry.
So we finally had a story.
School and union officials defended the
system, saying it provides an incentive
Uplink
for teachers (who eventually become
principals) to show up every day and
thus saves money spent on substi-
tute teachers. It also rewards Chicago
teachers who stick it out until retire-
ment and don't make as much money
as suburban teachers.
And it serves as a de facto retire-
ment incentive, allowing quicker re-
placement of top-scale teachers and
principals with lower-paid beginners.
But other experts pointed out that
the Chicago teachers and principals
also get another perk, that few, if
any, in private industry get - a pen-
sion that pays 75 percent of their
base retirement salary.
This project confirmed what Rossi
and I had learned in the CAR boot
camp. Getting the numbers is some-
times the easiest part of the story.
Figuring out what they mean, putting
them in context and then bringing
those numbers to life is the hard part.

had died years ago and that gave me
the idea to see if others who were
deceased or had their licenses re-
voked were still generating phar-
macy bills. They were.
When I matched the top billing phar-
macies with prescribing doctors, I no-
ticed that a small group of pharma-
cies had derived most of its Medic-
aid billings from prescriptions written
by one or two doctors, a situation
state officials later said raised the
possibility of kickback schemes.
But the most significant finding came
from checking the top prescribing
doctors against the overdose data-
base I created from autopsy and po-
lice reports.
It turned out that many, though not all,
of the highest Medicaid prescribing doc-
tors were the same ones with abnormally
high numbers of patient deaths. For ex-
ample, 16 of the top prescribers had a
combined 61 patient overdoses result-
ing in death in two years.
Many of these doctors also had been
disciplined previously by the state for
offenses that included drug traffick-
ing and trading drugs for sex.
I used the Florida Department of
Health's online physician profiles and
old binders with documents summa-
rizing disciplinary actions taken against
doctors. The profiles include a cat-
egory for "deceased," and helped to
identify dead doctors who were still
generating bills. The profiles and the
CD order form can be found on the
Web at www.doh.state.fl.us/MQA.
I also used the Internet-based Medi-
care and Medicaid exclusion list and
compared by hand every Florida doc-
tor who had been kicked out of Med-
icaid but still generated billings. (See
http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov/
search.html.)
Another data set that proved invalu-
able came from the Florida Agency
for Health Care Administration,
which oversees Florida's $12 billion-
March • April 2004
a-year program. I e-mailed a list of the
codes for all of the controlled drugs to
the agency's Medicaid pharmacy man-
ager, and he had the state's Medicaid
contractor provide at no cost a
Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with the
drug, doses purchased, cost of drug
and number of units for 2000 through
September 2003. This data showed
that dosage levels of certain drugs, in-
cluding Xanax bars and methadone,
had soared.
A project like this can be done in
states that grant access to autopsy
reports, though getting the Medicaid
data might take some tough negoti-
ating and even a lawsuit.
It's worth the expense and effort. Pre-
scription drug overdose deaths are
soaring nationwide and in many
states authorities believe Medicaid
helps fuel the illegal street market in
these pills. States facing huge cost
increases in Medicaid simply can't
afford to allow fraud schemes to go
unchecked.
Here are some tips for taking the re-
porting beyond the data analysis:
• Contact the families of people who
die. While many won't welcome a call
from a reporter, others will help you
get documentation such as pharmacy
receipts showing the dates victims
were prescribed pills and the
amounts.
• Seek the advice of legitimate pain
management doctors and pharma-
cists at their offices or stores. Many
will be helpful.
• Whenever possible, review the
complete file from a medical
examiner's death investigation. Many
times an investigator's notes will
have the phone number or comments
from the doctor who prescribed the
drugs. Phone numbers also are criti-
cal in making sure you have the right
physician.

Knight Ridder's investigative
team recently reported on the
dangers of doctors prescribing
drugs for treatments that haven't
been approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration.
See the March/April 2004 IRE
Journal for more details.
Reporter Chris Adams used
the FDA's Adverse Event
Reporting System, available
from the IRE and NICAR
Database Library, in the
investigation. Adams said that
the database was useful
because he could query it by
the type of drug and by the
physician's reason for the
prescription. The database
includes information about
adverse reactions to
prescription drugs.
Adams recommended allotting
plenty of time to work with the
data and to seek help as
needed from organizations
that use the data regularly.
In some cases, a doctor
and the drug producer
independently file reports
about an adverse reaction,
Adams said, so it's important
to check for duplicate records.
Adams supplemented his
analysis of the AERS data with
prescription data provided by
private companies.
For more information about the
database see www.ire.org/

statewide tool that is supposed to help
locate missing children.
The investigation began in July, with
just a simple search of data made
available on the Internet through the
state's Web site. A link to the Indiana
State Police Web site led to the Clear-
inghouse list, containing the names of
467 children supposedly missing 30
days or more. The list, which was in
fixed-width format, was easily imported
into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for
analysis. Four columns of information
contained the names of the missing
children, their birthdays, the dates they
were reported missing and the agen-
cies handling their cases.
First, I sorted the data and kept only
the records involving agencies within
our circulation area, placing those in a
separate spreadsheet. I used Microsoft
Access to count the number of cases
handled by each law enforcement
agency in the state.
That search showed two of the major
cities in our readership area

terms of the number of children re-
ported missing by single agencies. At
the very least, we could run a story
showing that Hammond, with 56 cases,
and Gary, with 60 cases, each had
nearly twice as many children on the
list as the state's largest city of India-
napolis, which had 32 cases.
Next, I created new columns in the
statewide and regional spreadsheets
and wrote formulas to calculate the
number of years or months each child
had been listed as missing. I also cal-
culated their current ages and the ages
at the time they disappeared. The re-
sults showed cases of children who
had been on the list for a number of
years, including a Hammond boy listed
as missing for 10 years following an
alleged abduction in a custody dispute.
After looking at the data, two lines of
reporting emerged: one on why cit-
ies in our region topped the list and
the other on the stories of children
who had been missing for a long time.

Those areas of focus changed slightly
following my first interview with the su-
pervisor of the Hammond Police
Department's juvenile division. During
the interview, the police sergeant
agreed to track down more information
on the cases of Leslie Richardson, re-
portedly missing for 10 years, and of
Talion Mansfield, who had been listed
as missing for two years. I was also
told that if I wanted copies of the origi-
nal missing children's reports filed by
parents or guardians, I would have to
file an open records request through
the city's legal department.
After the interview in Hammond I was
driving back to our main office in Munster
when my cell phone rang. The sergeant
was on the other end and he explained
to me that after making a couple of phone
calls in the Richardson case, he deter-
mined that the boy - reported missing at
the age of 4 and now 14-was no longer
missing. It appeared, the sergeant said,
that the boy's parents had never called
back to report that the custody dispute
leading to the report had been resolved.
The sergeant added that parents have
the responsibility to contact the authori-
ties once children are found and police
merely take the reports.
Shortly after I returned to the office my
cell phone rang again. This time the
sergeant reported that the other case I
had inquired about involved a child who
also was no longer missing and had
not been for quite some time. Again,
the sergeant blamed the original com-
plainant on the report for failing to close
out the case with the police.
At this point, red flags regarding the
list's accuracy and effectiveness be-
gan waving furiously. In a ground-
breaking series of stories that ran
nearly 20 years ago, The Denver Post
debunked inflated claims national child
abduction totals. (For a copy of the
Pulitzer Prize-winning stories contact

I filed public record requests for more
than 100 missing children reports from
Hammond and Gary and within three

weeks began sifting through each one,
gleaning contact numbers for parents
and calling them one by one. I used
people-finding tools on the Web to
track down some of the parents who
had moved or whose phone lines had
been disconnected.
That helped me find another 14 cases
from the region involving children who
had been listed as missing for years or
months but who had actually only been
missing for days or hours. In each case,
parents said that the police had never
contacted them for follow up after the
parents filed their initial report. And in
six of these cases, parents said they had
called the police to tell them their chil-
dren had been located.
I also called parents whose children re-
mained missing. Those parents reported
that police had also failed to follow up in
the cases of their children. We even fol-
lowed one woman who walked the
streets of Chicago's South Side, tack-
ing posters of her daughter to utility poles
because she was frustrated the police
did nothing to help locate her daughter.
Combing through all of the original re-
ports helped identify other angles for
the series. Runaways accounted for
most of the cases on the list. That be-
came the main angle for part two, which
outlined the problems and profiled
three chronic runaway children. For
part three, we focused on a Hammond
woman whose daughter had been ab-
ducted by her ex-husband and taken
to Egypt in 1993, never to return.
The impact of the story was felt al-
most immediately. Before the series
even ended, local state legislators
called upon the governor and the
state police for a probe of the Clear-
inghouse list and its inaccuracies.
The matter remains under review,
and a northwest Indiana congress-
man and a state lawmaker are con-
sidering legislation that would require
police agencies to regularly follow up
on missing children's cases.
