Dear Readers:
I would like to take this opportunity
to introduce myself as the new editor
of Uplink. I am taking over for Bob
Jackson, who is still with MICAR, and
can be reached at his old number.
However, beginning with this issue. I
will field any questions or comments
concerning Uplink.

We also have added a new
designer to our staff. Joyesha Bhat-
tacharya created Uplink's new cover
design, and in the coming months will
be working on a complete makeover
of the newsletter.

The purpose of the redesign is to
build on Bob's foundation and make
Uplink a more "user friendly" newslet-
ter. Upcoming issues will feature
more graphics and photos, plus
greater opportunities for reader input.
We want Uplink to be as useful a tool
to you as your computer.

We appreciate continued corre-
spondence from our readers: not only
your successes, but your problems
and pitfalls as you boldly go where
few reporters have gone before.

-Please call us at (314) 882-0684
with any questions or comments.

Star reporter
dodges USDA
obstacles

By David Raziq
MICAR

"From the standpoint of computer-assisted
reporting, this was a techno-nightmare," said Kansas
City Star reporter Greg Reeves. "It took three gigabites
of space, the tapes blew up my Qualstar 1260 taped-
rive and the number of records overwhelmed XDB."
But Reeves isn't complaining, because the "nightmare"
he's describing is "Failing the Grade", a comprehe-
sive and critical look at the United States Department
of Agriculture that this April won his paper a Pulitzer
Prize for national reporting. The effort of reporters
Mike McGraw, Jeff Taylor, Reeves and editor Mark
Ziemann, the seven-part series also won an Investiga
tive Reporters and Editors Award earlier this year.

The Star's investigation began nearly two years
ago as the result of previous stories by reporters
McGraw and Taylor. One such story included the
problem of "dirty grain": farmers and grain producers
adding dirt to grain export to increase the weight and
therefore the price of shipments. That and other
chronic problems, says Reeves, convinced the Star that
the USDA's troubles "went much deeper than any-
one realized and so the project began. Eleven months
later, Reeves joined the investigation.

"For my part of it," he says, "I asked the
USDA for the last five years in farm subsidy pay-
ments." The USDA pays out over ten billion dollars in
subsidies and Reeves suspected he might find some ir-
regularities to those payments. But Reeves' effort
soon hit a snag when the government denied his
request.

"We started throwing lawyers at each other,"
Reeves said, but "unlike other agencies that ultimately
agree to give you the records, the USDA said go
ahead and sue us. I think they denied us access simply
because they had never given them to anybody before
and because bureaucrats tend to believe its their
infromation and not the public's."

Greg Reeves spent
months trying to access
USDA farm subsidy
tapes.

But getting the
tapes was the easy part.

Three months later a compromise was finally
reached: The USDA would provide 8.2 million com-
puter records of only 1990's payments. Those tapes
included the check's serial number.the date, county,
and state the check was issued for, and even an identi-
fying number for the intended farmer but excluded the
ceiver's name and address.

However that was just the beginning of
Reeve's problems, because with the tapes in hand, he
now experienced difficulties in down-loading the
information into his computer. "Our tapedrive could
not read these tapes. The tape quality was marginal
and the Qualstar 1260 is a piece of trash when it comes
to reading marginal tapes."

Reeves says that although a recent upgrade has
solved most of the Qualstar's reading problems, he felt
discouraged at the time. Starting in July 1991, Reeves
says he "worked nearly around the clock seven days a
week to load these tapes to my PC... We failed."

So Reeves decided to install the nine tapes on
the Star's Vax Mainframe processer using NineTrack
Express for the download and then Datatrieve, the
mainframe's database software, for the analysis.

"I wrote hundreds of programs to extract this
data," says Reeves, and in some cases ran each of
them dozens of times" for a two-month period. Finally
he created an analysis based on those farmers who got
most payments along with their county and state.
at the investigation was still missing one thing: the
names of the farmers or producers receiving the
money.

So using the check's serial number, the date
of issue, and purpose, Reeves began calling various
county USDA offices to match the checks with their
receivers.

As a result, one of the investigation's findings
included the unchecked growth of what Reeves calls
"Mississippi Christmas Trees."

"We've found that in ten states," he says,
"there are more farmers getting farm subsidy pay-
ments than there are farms. What's happened is the
farmer's have split up their farms under so many
different ownerships in order to skirt the USDA's
fifty-thousand dollar per farmer limitation." Asa
result, the Star's team found wives, children, cousins,
uncles, and even family doctors and lawyers all listed
as producers with the USDA and thus receiving
subsidy checks.

Although Reeves depended on a mainframe
for "Failing the Grade," he says he still primarily
believes in PC-oriented research methods and has
some recommendations for those organizations just
starting their own computer-assisted programs.

"Go for a PC-based set up that takes care of
your needs at least two years out: namely a 486 33
megahertz with a minimum two giga-byte harddrive,"
he says. In addition, Reeves recommends Foxpro,
Paradox, or SAS database software for the analysis,
NineTrack Express for downloading tapes, and a
Pertech, Cipher, or Storagtech tape drive. "The
whole set-up" says Reeves, "would be around twenty
thousand dollars."

Letters

Dear Uplink:
I got my April 1992 Uplink today and was intrigued by the reports of
problems with XDB software. I have had some of the same problems,
and I'll be waiting to hear what solutions arise.

I got XDB 2.30 in May 1991. We have not yet attempted any
projects as complicated as those described by Robert Paynter, so I
hadn't run into the problems with indexing, but I had noticed two other
problems mentioned in the article: the software would give some sorts
out of order (the decimal point example cited by Ed Foldessy of the Wall
Street Journal is a perfect parallel), and its computations were not
always trustworthy.

As an example of the former, I've run a fair number of queries on
census data, and I frequently found that when I calculated percent-
ages say, ranking census tracts by percentages of minority resi-
dents-two percentages that were a point or two apart would occa-
sionally appear out of order. I eliminated most of those problems by
simply adding another float decimal place (F10 utility menu, then F5
user profile, then F6 format options, then F8 float decimal places), but
that didn't get rid of them all, and even with version 2.41 I've had to
keep a close on any calculations and oderings in which decimal places
were significant. Perhaps I should've been less tolerant.

I ran into the other computational problems in working with a cut-
down version of the 1989 Toxic Release Inventory data for North Caro-
lina. I found that XDB 2.30 could rank them accurately statewide-it
seemed to ignore any record with a toxics total exceeding seven digits,
of which we had at least one. (This wasn't apparent from the data
itself; fortunately, we had other TRI reports with which to compare
some of our data and could tell right off that there was a problem.)
However, version 2.41 totals the larger numbers accurately.

One other problem that 2.41 solved for us was using the PC's
random access memory. We bought four megs of RAM with the
machine, and in my relative ignorance of computers I'd assumed that if
it was in the machine, it was being used. Meanwhile, when I tried to
import census data into 400-field tables and kept getting the X10 error
message-insufficient RAM-I just figured that four megs wasn't
enough and built smaller tables. I didn't learn about basic versus
extended memory until stumbling over Jack Warner's computer column
from Cox News Service on the on the wire a couple of months ago-it
explained what the problem was, although it didn't suggest anything to
solve it that worked for us. Dave Stroble, our audiotext product
manager and a PC fiend, futzed around with my AUTOEXEC.BAT and
CONFIG.SYS files but couldn't solve the problem. Then we got XDB
2.41 and its extended memory manager. I don't know exactly how it
works, but since I installed 2.41, I've had no more problems with
totaling numbers or importing files with many fields. (I haven't had
occasion to try 400, but I have gone as high as 288 with no problem.
Not only that, 2.41 appears to import about 20 percent faster that 2.30.)

If XDB has figured out how to fix the ordering bug, I'd like to hear
about it. Meanwhile, please keep us posted on other problems, even if
it doesn't make for as compelling reading as does the Hartford Cour-
ant's's serial killer!

Investigative/Database Reporter, Hartford Courant

Bytes, bits and nibbles..

Reporters and editors around the United States
are warming up to the idea of integrating computers
into journalism. And if the packed seminar on
computer-assisted reporting at the Investigative
Reporters and Editors conference in Atlanta is
any indication, the coming years will see the con-
cept catch fire in our nations newsrooms.

"This is not a luxury. This is not the future. This is
a way to get information now," said Bill Dedman,
I.R.E. Board Member and freelancer. Dedman, who
is currently writing a book on computer-assisted re-
porting along with MICAR founder Elliot Jaspin,
said the use of computers in investigative journalism
is changing the way government and the media do
business together.

The Freedom of Information Act and access laws
are slowly beginning to facilitate the process for
those who use this new technology.

"The general premise is that if you can get it on
paper, you can get it on computer." But, Dedman
said state and local governments are routinely
putting roadblocks in the way of reporters who
attempt to gain access to computer records.

For example:
The state of North Carolina's attempt to charge
the Raleigh News and Observer more than $12
million for the state's driver license records, which
are on nine-track magnetic tape. The state and the
newspaper are currently in litigation to decide on a
fair price for the records. "The federal government
has spent billions of dollars inputting information on
more than 32,000 mainframe computers," Dedman
said. "And it spends no money telling you which
databases it has."

Despite the government's obstacles, reporters are
turning out award-winning stories that would have
been impossible to complete without computers.
The News & Observer has arguably one of the
best computer-assisted programs in the country.
With about half of their newsroom trained in analyz-
ing computer databases, the newspaper churns out

computer-based stories on a daily basis.
Here's a taste of what the News & Observer has
been working on the past few months:

*Computer analysis of North Carolina Marriage
records for the past 20 years yielded an interesting
story for reporter Mary Miller. Her analysis found
that although Friday is the most popular day to get
married at the Wake County Courthouse, the 13th is
always a slow day. It seems that people are supersti-
tious about the 13th, no matter what day of the week it
falls on.

*News & Observer reporter Carol Blaney
performed a computer analysis of the state's escheat
and unclaimed property program and was able to detail
how uncashed checks, stocks, forgotten accounts,
jewelry and cash left at hospitals, banks and other
businesses can be found. Her story, "Wake residents
owed $305,579: Escheats office holding millions in
unclaimed funds," explains how the state runs the
gram and how the interest is used to fund the
program and provide college scholarships.

*In February, reporters Steve Riley and C.E.
Yandle performed a computer analysis of records
from the labor department and the state office of the
chief medical examiner. They found that because of
Labor Department oversights, many on-the-job deaths
remain uninvestigated. Their story, which ran last
month, detailed seven cases of workers dying on the
job. The deaths were never reported to all the correct
authorities and never fully investigated. The News &
Observer story stated that the Labor Department
misses one worker death in four and the department
relies on employers and the news media to notify them
of worker deaths instead of checking in with medical
examiners and taking a more proactive stance.

Also busy turning out computer-assisted stories are
Doug McInnis and Steve Stephens of The Co-
lumbus Dispatch. The reporters recently completed

from around the nation

a computer analysis of drug- crime records and con-
ducted scores of interviews. The end result was a
series entitled "Drug killings boom in just 16 months."

The series depicts the drive-by killings, crack
killings and other drug killings that have shattered
Columbus' image as a big city without big-city crime.
The series includes graphics of the rising pace of drug-
related killings and statistics revealing that they have
become the leading type of homicide in Columbus.

Computers are being used more and more on break-
ing stories. For example, when a plane crashed in
Dayton, a reporter using a computer discovered that
the plane had previously had 32 serious maintenance
problems.

Hal Straus from the Atlanta-Journal
Constitution pointed out the trend toward using the
computer to enhance solid beat reporting. Journal-
Constitution reporters used a database to trace cam-
paign contributions to Atlanta's governor and lt. gover-
nor. They found that the sponsor of a bill, allowing
beverage companies to label just about anything short
of sewage as spring water, had contributed heavily to
the two campaigns.

"It took five minutes to search the database and get
a really good story," Straus said.

IRE seminar
The widespread interest in computer
assisted reporting has led IRE to establish
its first all-day seminar on the subject at its
national conference in Portland, Oregon.
The conference will take place from June
11 to June 14, 1992. For more information
telephone IRE at (314) 882-2042.

Easing the fear of a financial collapse

by Trebor Banstetter
MICAR

The bank of New England failed in early January of
1991. It was the biggest bank failure in the history of
the United States, and the financial catastrophe caused
great concern among New Jersey residents who kept
their money in local banks and thrifts.

"The people of New Jersey were very nervous
about the safety of their banks," said Dan Woods,
business writer for the Record of Hackensack, N.J.
The fear was so pervasive, Woods said, that a thrift in
Patterson, N.J., had a "run" _ de-
positors withdrawing all of their
savings because of a takeover by
United Savings Bank. "There was
poor communication, and people
thought their money was going to
disappear," he said.

"We wanted to give them
some information on how safe
their bank was."

Woods wanted to create a
ranking of banks and thrifts that
would assist consumers in choos-
ing what financial institution was
safest. He decided to use a pub-
licly available database provided
by Ferguson and Co.

The people of New
Jersey were very
nervous about the
safety of their banks.
We wanted to give
the information on
how safe their bank
was.
-Dan Woods

The data was based on Federal Deposit Insur-
ance Corp. call reports, which are detailed financial
reports banks have to file each quarter, and are avail-
able on a CD-ROM disk. Obtaining the information
from the disk and downloading it into a database
program is very similar to using nine-track magnetic
tapes.

The best way to determine a rating for a bank
or thrift, Woods decided, was to use a formula compar-
ing an institution's capital and its problem loans. "In a
failed bank, the losses from the problem loans keep
piling up and eating away the capital," he said.

Each bank's capital and problem loans was
divided by the bank's assets to produce a percentage.
The capital percentage gave an indicator of how much
the bank had saved over the years to act as "a cushion

of last resort." The problem loans indicated how good
the bank was at making loans.

The capital percentage and the problem loan
percentage were given equal weight in the ranking,
and were converted into the standard deviation to
equalize the numbers. Then, each bank had a ranking
between one and five.

"After the story ran, consumers were wildly
enthusiastic," Woods said. "This gave them a way to
judge the basic safety of their
bank."

One of the biggest concerns
Woods had was making sure the
story presented the data accurately
and fairly. "We were very con-
scious of the fact that people
would use these ratings to move
their money, so we checked the
data and methodology to the
extreme," he said. He also pointed
out banks and thrifts that had low
rankings but good recovery pro-
grams.

Woods made sure to include in-
formation on deposit insurance, so
readers understood their savings were insured by the
federal government if under $100,000. "We didn't
want to cause hysteria," he said.

In 1992, Woods did a second ranking, this time
including several significant out-of-state banks. "Again,
the response was overwhelming."

The stories have won several awards, including
a third prize in the enterprise category from the New
Jersey Press Association. They also won a C.T.
Rutgers award for business reporting.

Woods encourages others to try similar rank-
ings of financial institutions in their areas, but warns
that extreme caution and care must be used. "If you
print the wrong data, it can be devastating," he said.

But, he added, "It's definitely worth the effort.
I have received calls from senior citizens who told me
they would sleep a little easier."
