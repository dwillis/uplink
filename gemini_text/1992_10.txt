Writing a computer-assisted
story in less than a week

Van Denton, a beat reporter for
the Raleigh (N.C.) News &
Observer, was doing a routine
assignment. He didn't need to look for
a faster way. But he did, and he ended
up with much more than a routine
story. All it took was a newly formed
database and a floppy disk.

Every year, Denton's paper does a
story on the amount of money lobbyists
spend wining and dining legislators.
The information was only available on
hard copy, which required searching
through voluminous documentation,
making calculations and coming out
with a story in a couple of weeks.

Denton started early, looked
around a little and found a person in the
secretary of state's office who was
building a database with all the needed
information. A couple of weeks later,
when all the data was in, he took a
floppy disk down to the secretary and
had the file copied, at no cost to the
newspaper.

His story was ready two days later
and included not only how much
lobbyists spent, in total and per legisla-
tor, but also was broken down by
interest group, such as medicine or
insurance. He got a better, more
complex story, in less time.

There are hundreds of examples of
reporters who have done in-depth
investigations over months, or even
years, using computer-assisted report-
ing. However, reporters all over the
country, from North Carolina to
Washington state, are turning over
stories in a week or less with the help of
a database and some creative thinking.
These reporters are putting out faster,
harder-hitting stories long before their
competition.

Here's a simple rule to follow: If
you're going through volumes of
documents, ask if there's a tape some-
where. Then find someone who knows
what to do with it.

Pat Stith has been The News &
Observer's computer expert for the past
two years. He said the paper put out 31
articles in the past year using computer-
assisted reporting. Also, a 20-hour
training program was set up to remove
the mystique for beat reporters.

Denton took the course, which he
said made him aware of possibilities of
this technique. On the lobby story, he
was faced with 866 reports to be
analyzed over the course of a couple of
weeks. He looked for another way.
Then he found out about the database
at the secretary of state's office.

On a Wednesday, Denton got a
copy of the database and brought it
back to Stith in the newsroom. Stith
said the "little bitty database," a flat file,
took "five seconds" to load into
Foxpro. Reports were ready for
Denton to take home by the end of the
day.

Denton had requested reports on
many possible combinations of the
information. When he went through
the reports that Wednesday night, he
tagged all the special interest groups.
The next morning, Stith created a new
field for groups, such as oil, insurance
and medicine, and printed more
reports calculating amount spent by
each group.

Denton did follow-up interviews
and had the story ready on Friday. But
it ran on Sunday's front page, because,
after all, they were weeks ahead of their
competition.

"I'm more interested in something
I can use every day," said Denton. "It's
just a tool to get a story like any other
tool."

Penny Loeb of New York Newsday
made it through 500 pages of a 1,000-
page document before she thought,
"This has got to be on a tape some-
where." Sure enough, it was.

She and Kevin Flynn were investi-
gating allegations that attorneys were
making contributions to Attorney
General Robert Abrams' campaign for
the U.S. Senate while they had business
pending with the his office. The
reporters discovered that Abrams had
received more than $120,000 for his
campaign from attorneys who do
business with his office, including

Here's a simple rule to follow: If you're going
through volumes of documents, ask if there's a
tape somewhere. Then find someone who
knows what to do with it.

$33,000 from lawyers who had matters pending
before him at the time of the contributions.
After six hours of searching through
documents, Loeb looked for a tape. She got a
tape from the attorney general's office, but a
record layout, telling her how to load it, was not
included. She counted some fields and made
her own record layout. She loaded the tape in
about two hours.

With the tape, Loeb could immediately go
into the database and see names of attorneys
who had pending business.
Loeb printed two sets of reports, one from
the attorney general's list of pending business
and one from the Federal Election Committee's
list of campaign contributions. Since neither list
identified law firms, she had to do a little
creative thinking.

Loeb asked herself what distinguishing
characteristics are in law firms' names. Of course
- ampersands! She printed reports of all occupa-
tions with ampersands in the company name.
Then she went through both lists by hand,
matching up the names.

Loeb loaded the tape on Friday, Aug. 28. By
the following day, she had identified 12 in-
stances of lawyers making contributions while
they had matters pending. However, she wasn't
sure she had the right firms.

On Tuesday, Sept. 1, she and Flynn got on
the phones to the law firms to interview them
and confirm the data. Loeb said this took three
days and was the most time-consuming part of
the story.

By Friday, Sept. 4, the writing was done. The
story was scheduled for Sunday the 6th, but ran

on Tuesday the 8th. All together, Loeb and
Flynn churned out the hard-hitting story in
eight days.

Another story that took about a week came
from Brant Houston at The Hartford (Conn.)
Courant. A breaking story on a possible serial
murderer had been unfolding over the course
of a couple weeks. Houston built his own
database in XDB, using clips on unsolved
murders. He included dates, descriptions of the
female victims, time and place the body was
found, demographic information and race.
This took a few hours.

Next, Houston went to the medical
examiner's office and made a separate data-
base, to which he added significantly more
information. After a couple of days, he had a
clean printout with a couple of hundred
records.

It took about an hour of database searches
to see a pattern.

After two to three days of interviewing and
updating information, the first story came out.
Houston had established a possible pattern and
enough connections that the state created an
investigative task force. Additional stories were
published and Houston's stories acted as a
"tipster" for law enforcement officials.

"Once you have a database in-house, you
seldom use it just once," Houston said.

Bob Wodnik of The Everett (Wash.)
Herald agreed. His XDB database on building
permit records had been used for numerous
stories. Wodnik, Scott North and Jim Muhl
did a story in three days on increased develo
ment which led to more stormwater runoff into
an already flood-prone area.

With this story, there was no problem of
building, finding or copying a database. It was
there, and the reporters had become used to it,
which made the quick story even easier.

George Landau, at the St. Louis Post-
Dispatch, said his paper had done quick stories
with in-house databases, too. Three examples
came from computerized Missouri death
certificates:
■ Deaths from breast cancer were occurring at a
higher rate (in certain age ranges) in the city of
St. Louis than in the county or in the state as a
whole.
■ No decline was shown in the number of
drowning deaths among children for the last 12
years in the St. Louis area or the state as a
whole.
■ The rate of asthma deaths increased in
Missouri over the last 12 years.

Stith said it's a realistic goal for the News &
Observer to run a computer-assisted story every
week.
"You could sit there in one database and do
ten stories," he said. But, he added, the objec-
tive is to find one good story and get it in the
paper.

When TRI is not enough, try
state hazardous waste manifests

When it comes to environmental issues,
particularly the treatment and disposal of
hazardous material, Uplink often touts the EPA's
Toxic Release Inventory. TRI is a database with
untold uses, but it contains generalized data and
provides little detail with regard to the fate of
hazardous materials.

TRI records scarcely go beyond "Off-site
Transfer" when describing the fate of the
millions of tons of hazardous materials that were
stored, treated and/or shipped offsite by the
thousands of large-quantity waste generators in
the United States.

TRI serves as excellent summary material and
a good initial source for information concerning
manufacturers and their toxic chemical dis-
charges. The challenge for computer-assisted
reporters is to find new databases on local or
state levels and use them to develop more
detailed applications in the environmental arena
to supplement the federal perspective. At
Electronic Public Information Consultants
(EPIC), we tap into data that helps make this
possible: state hazardous waste manifests.

Hazardous waste manifests are one of the
many consequences of the 1976 Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act. In theory, RCRA
is supposed to help environmental enforcement
agencies track every ounce of hazardous material
"from cradle to grave." In short, the act compels
manufacturers that create and ship hazardous
materials to complete Uniform Hazardous Waste
Manifest forms every time waste leaves their
facilities.

Despite the name, there is no such thing as a
standardized UHWM form. Some manufacturers
actually generate their own forms. However,
RCRA does specify reporting requirements. The
manifest must not only describe hazardous
material in superb detail, but also must specify
who is transporting the material, where it is
going (even if out of state), when the material is
shipped, and just about anything else you would
want to know about the material's transport,
delivery and disposal.

Using hazardous waste manifests, reporters
can track the transport of hazardous materials
through their state. In all likelihood, they can
also identify the source and destination of the
most menacing material, cross-reference the data
with TRI and state enforcement data to deter-
mine if discharge figures are consistent, and even
identify illegal transport activities. Needless to
say, reporters can thereby add a tremendous
amount of detail to TRI's "Off-site Transfer"
records.

The good news for computer-assisted report-
ers is that about half the states in the United
States are using computers to compile UHWMs.
They are: Alaska, Arkansas, California, Con-
necticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,
Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York,
New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas,
Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. As of last
year, Alabama, West Virginia, and Maine were
planning to automate.

The other states, as you might imagine, are
complaining about volume problems and their
relative inability to handle the information.
Ohio, for example, supplements its current
system (or lack thereof) by purchasing manifest
databases from bordering states - Pennsylvania,
Michigan, and Indiana - all of which have
automated systems. You can take a similar
approach if your state is not using computers. At
this point, it is difficult to be specific about fees
for data. EPIC paid $86 for Texas manifests,
Illinois manifests are free of charge, and New
Jersey charges $4.50 per second of CPU time
with a $500 maximum fee.

Requesting data should not be difficult. A
data processor at the Department of Natural
Resources in New Jersey boasted that he fills
hundreds of requests for manifest databases
each month (don't worry, he couldn't recall
doing much work for journalists). Whether he
was exaggerating or not, he did make it clear
that obtaining data was no problem.

State agencies store manifests anywhere from
three years to indefinitely. Unfortunately, every
state will have a different agency responsible for
compiling the manifest data, and each will have
different policies concerning format and
maintenance.

One way to get started would be to call the
agency in your state responsible for enforcing
environmental permits (e.g. Department of
Natural Resources, state Environmental Protec-
tion Agency, or Department of Ecology). If that
fails, call your state Department of Transporta-
tion. EPIC has started to compile as many of
these hazardous waste databases as possible.
Feel free to call us.

For more information regarding hazardous
waste manifests, there is an excellent, free
resource manual called "A State Guide to the
Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest" published
by the National Governors Association (444
North Capitol Street, Washington, D.C., 20001-
1572). In addition to describing the manifest
process in detail, the guide identifies appropri-
ate agencies and contacts in every state.

The manifest not
only describes
hazardous material
in superb detail but
also specifies who is
transporting the
material, where it is
going, when the
material is shipped
and just about
anything else you
would want to
know about the
material's
transport, delivery
and disposal.

The National Library on Money & Politics
searches databases for you

Think about what the civics and history
books tell young citizens about democ-
racy and voting, how the members of
Congress represent The People in their
district, about the Power of One Person in the
Voting Booth.

And now, think of this, from the Real
World. Every member of Congress has two
constituencies. The first has the most people —
the citizens of that district: the few who voted
for the winner, the few who voted against and
the majority who didn't vote at all.

The other constituency, the one not in
the schoolbooks, has the most power. The
congressperson knows every member. They
gave the money for the expensive campaign.
And the high cost of modern campaigning
means that the congressperson spends a great
deal of time with this limited group of people
who have the money and motivation —
business, political, ideological — to give to
campaigns.

There are lots of stories in tracing what
money does to politics. Most of the informa-
tion is on record. It affects just about every
aspect of the lives of the people who read your
paper or listen to your broadcasts. Since
you're a reporter, you should be figuring out
what the data means and then telling the
stories to your readers and viewers.

So what does it take to get started? You
can go to the Federal Election Commission
with your FOIA request, pay the fees, load the
tapes, convert the data to a form your software
can import and start figuring out how to write
the queries.

But the National Library on Money &
Politics has already done this. You can get
more information, in less time, with less
trouble. And in many cases it will cost your
news organization less than the mileage to the
state high school football championship.

Common requests for data:
■ Tables of all the PAC and individual
contributions to a congressperson over a
certain period
■ How much money did Senator Z get from
energy interests? From transportation?
■ How much money have cable industry PACs
given since 1980?

The Library gives you information that's
not in the FEC records — a coding system that
identifies the political/ideological/business
interest of the Political Action Committees.
The FEC has the PAC's full official name and
the sponsor, but many PAC names give you no
clue about what their interest is.

The Library already bought all the tapes,
with all the data, all the way back to 1979. It
can give you information that covers just the
states, districts, officials and years you're
interested in. You can get the data for just one
congressperson now, and after those stories
are done, decide to order all the data about
the two senators in your state.

The FEC's job is to maintain the records
and make them available to the public. The
Library's job is help reporters figure out what
data they need and get it to them quickly. If
reporters need help deciding how to approach
the data, or finding the stories in the data, the
Library staff can help. They know campaign
finance and they've been reporters, too.

Some common requests for data: Send
the tables of all the PAC and individual
contributions to a congressperson over a
certain period. How much money did Senator
Z get from energy interests? From the trans-
portation industry? Some questions can be
answered with just a fax or a return phone call:
How much money have cable industry PACs
given since 1980?

You may want to start out with everything
for your state since 1979. That would include
all the individual contributors in your state
who gave to PACs, political parties and
presidential candidates; and all the contribu-
tions from PACs and individuals to Congres-
sional candidates in your state.

The data is put on floppies in the format
you choose: CSV format, a DBF file for Foxpro
and dBase, or a Paradox file. We can send it to
you Federal Express or, even better and faster,
to your Compuserve E-mail.

The National Library on Money &
Politics is affiliated with the Center for Respon-
sive Politics. The Library is a non-profit, non-
partisan public education service. The offices
are at 1320 19th St. NW, Washington, DC
20036. The Library's phone number is (202)

Tech Tips:

FoxPro adds a new dimension to SQL

FoxPro's Point and Shoot SQL Interface can
smooth the way for beginners.
The great thing about Structured Query
Language is that it is simple, powerful and for the
most part, easy. Beginners can get started
quickly, and pros can go as fast as they need to.
It's no surprise that SQL has been adopted by
reporters enthusiastically.

For the first stage of a program of computer-
assisted reporting, SQL releases the power of the
highly-motivated individuals who are driving the
effort. But after a small cadre of reporters has hit a
few home runs, knowledge must spread through-
out the newsroom in order to avoid a bottleneck.
That's why training eventually becomes one of the
top, if not the top priority to ensure the success of
a program of computer-assisted reporting.

For those news organizations using FoxPro
Version 2.0, the Relational Query By Example
interface provides a tremendous tool for teaching
SQL to beginners. No matter how easy SQL may
seem to the initiated, beginners need, and should
have, as much help as possible.

What the Relational Query By Example
interface does is provide a point and shoot menu
interface for SQL. For each portion of the SQL
statement, the user chooses from a menu instead
of typing the command. For the seasoned SQL
programmer, this may seem awkward at first. I
know it did for me, but now I write almost all of my
SQL statements using RQBE.

The benefit for beginners is that they don't have
to sit there facing a SELECT statement, wonder-
ing what to type next. With the RQBE interface,
they can play around and use menus to build the
statement they want as follows.

To enter the RQBE interface, a FoxPro user
creates a new query file by choosing New from
the file menu and specifying the file type as
Query. This displays the interface screen depicted
in the diagram.

When FoxPro creates the query, it assumes
that whichever database is open will be the
subject of the query. If this isn't the correct
database, then it can be cleared from the screen,
and another database can be added from a menu
of all available databases. If a database named
"DB1" were open, then that database would be
used for the query and its fields would be dis-
played in the Select Fields window.

The user can change which fields appear in the
query, or to choose various functions, such as
SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.

When a user adds a second database to the
query, say "DB2" FoxPro pops up a menu-driven
interface to the WHERE clause. Instead of typing
in WHERE DB2.IDNUM = DB1.IDNUM, the
WHERE interface allows a user to point and
shoot. First a menu of all the fields in the DB2
database is presented so the user can select
the appropriate field to join the databases
together. Then the user selects the comparison
operator, (LIKE or =, EXACTLY LIKE or ==,
etc.), and finally a menu of fields from the DB1
database appears.

After the WHERE menu has been filled out,
the where clause will appear in the large box at
the bottom left of the screen. Also, all of the
fields in the DB2 database will appear when the
Select Fields menu is chosen. The same style
interface is available for the ORDER BY,
GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.

The menus are nice for queries that use
several databases, because the job of placing
the alias tags that identify which field belongs
to which database is handled automatically.

When I first started to use this interface, I
balked because I thought that it was a replace-
ment for SQL, not a way to learn it. As soon as
I clicked on the See SQL box, I realized I was
wrong. Clicking on this box displays the SQL
query built by the interface. A beginner can
point and shoot for a while, then look at the
SQL that he or she has created.

Once the query has been completed, then it
can be executed. The output can be directed to
a temporary database for browsing, a perma-
nent database for later use, or a report for
printing.

The University of Louisville in Ken-
tucky has set up an online forum for working
journalists and journalism educators, news
librarians and researchers.

Computer-Assisted Research and Report-
ing List, or CARR-L, as this corner of cyberspace
is called, focuses on the use of computers in
journalism.

Topics range from text processing and
graphics to online database searching, computer
communications and investigative reporting,
according to Elliot Parker, one of CARR-L's
curators.

The nature of the exchange depends on
the users, but here are a few topics which have
passed through CARR-L recently: Where do we
get state-level information in electronic form
and how do we know what is available?; is there a
net source for backgrounding information on
hurricanes?; software reviews, job announce-
ments.

More problems have surfaced in
the 1990 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act
(HMDA) data.

Last month Anchorage Daily News
reporter Bruce Melzer told Uplink that the
Feds used the state abbreviation "AK" for
Arkansas as well as Alaska in the bank address
file.

This didn't seem like a problem at the
time since the loan applications, listed in a
separate file, used a numeric code to identify
states.

However, Melzer found that "02", the
code for Alaska, was also used for Arizona
part of the time. Of course, this means Alaska
records could be hidden under some other
state code.

When asked about this, Cornelius
Driggins at the Federal Reserve said the
problem falls within their accepted 3 percent
error rate.

Unfortunately for Melzer, the error rate
in Alaska runs closer to 35 percent, with 2,077
Arizona loan applications recorded under
"02".
