A newsletter for the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting

Uplink update

Check-up time.
Reporters are using computers to probe the medical industry. From the business of health care to dying babies, journalists are using data-bases for better stories. This month, Uplink focuses on those efforts. The coverage begins on page 4.
The Poynter Institute's Nora Paul tells you where to go on the Internet for information on health-care fi-nances. Reporters from Newsday, U.S. News & World Report, Hart-ford Courant and Tacoma (Wash.) News Tribune offer tips from their work. Those range from examining transplant survival rates to uncover-ing hospitals that infect patients.
In addition, goverment agencies are beginning to offer certain re-ports only on-line. Check the back page for two that have started to release information only that way. More parts of the federal govern-ment are considering such moves. It's one more sign that computer-assisted reporting is not optional for newsrooms.

Untapping dirty tap water
Oh, those dirty rats

By Alan Levin
The Hartford Courant

Dead rodents. Bloated the size of footballs.
These are what engineer John Wittenzellner found when he first lifted the lid on the drinking water storage tank supplying about 100 residents of bu-colic Durham, Conn.
Local residents wondered why for years their tap water contained high lev-els of bacteria.
Bloated rodents aren't what com-monly come to mind when we think of the results of a computer-assisted story. But we found Wittenzellner, who was one of The Hartford Courant's best sources in its three-part series, "A Drop of Safety," through computer data.
The series showed that even in Con-necticut, which has one of the toughest enforcement programs in the country, about 750,000 people received drinking water from among the hundreds of sys-tems cited for serious safety violations in the last five years.
The problem was particularly acute among systems serving fewer than 500 people. Well over half of those small water companies had chronically failed to test for contaminants, found poten-tially dangerous levels of bacteria, im-properly treated the water or exceeded allowable levels of chemical contami-nants in recent years.
Among the worst of these utilities, enforcement was a joke. In the system that Wittenzellner took over and re-paired two years ago, the state had tried in vain for nearly 15 years to force the former owner to improve treatment.
We knew when we began that scien-tists were raising warning flags about drinking water safety. Studies estimated that as many as a third of stomach ail-ments are waterborne. A 1993 parasite outbreak in Milwaukee's water sick-ened 400,000 people and is believed to have killed up to 100 AIDS patients.

A key EPA database
The starting point we used to identify the risks in Connecticut was the massive federal database collected since the late 1970s by the U.S. Environmental Pro-tection Agency. It is known as FRDS.
Every violation handed out to all but the smallest water companies across the country has been logged in the federal system. Every state and federal enforce-ment action also resides in the database. And very few people outside of EPA have ever looked at it.
State officials asked us for a copy because, even though they provide the data used by EPA, federal officials had not figured out an easy way to give the data back to the state in a usable form. Several water utilities downloaded our data when we put it on our bulletin board because they, too, had no other way to ascertain their record of violations with-out a lengthy paper search through nu-merous file cabinets.
The FRDS system is dizzying.
In total, it contains more than a dozen separate databases that are linked on an old mainframe system. Its contents — listings of violations, enforcement ac-tions and names of contaminants — are

all encoded. The records were created to mirror the federal drinking water regulations, which are also head-spinning in complexity.
But don't despair.
Though lengthy, the documentation is the most comprehensive, easiest to use I've ever encountered. It includes a separate page for each field. Its format is easy to read. The consultants who created the system were pa-tient, even pleasant, as I asked questions about its form and function.
We opted to obtain only the Connecticut data. It included several databases. The ones we used most were: a listing of each of the 6,000 water utilities in the state, another file with data about each water utility's water sources and location, a database containing all 13,000 violations handed out in the last 15 years and another listing every enforcement action for the same period. The files were linked by an identification number.

Know what the data means
We created a series of additional tables that were used to more easily spell out the names of contaminants.
There was an awkward learning curve while we figured out how the federal drinking water regulations work. The computer records are worthless, even misleading, without this knowl-edge.
For example, for virtually every listed vio-lation there is a contaminant, mostly grisly looking chemicals like benzene.
When I first saw these chemicals, I thought we had an epidemic on our hands. It turned out benzene had never been detected in Connecti-cut drinking water. Instead, every benzene listing (and most of the other chemical list-ings) was there because the water utility had failed to test for it.

Figuring out formulas
These failures to monitor for chemicals were significant to our story, but hardly equalled evidence that the chemical was actually in the drinking water.
Then we had to figure out a formula with which to rate the thousands of violations so that we could identify the state's worst water providers. Interviews with water engineers and regulators helped.
Once we got to this point, the data began to point us toward the human stories that turn a boring computer-generated story into something readable.

Data leads to real stories
That's what led us to Wittenzellner. It turned out he had extensive experience repairing some of the worst small water companies in the state. In addition to rodents, he told us he had found various species of dead animals in neglected water systems throughout the state.
Telephoning residents who received water from one system Wittenzellner had taken over, we found a man who made the mistake of drink-ing the water when he first moved in to his house. "It was like Cancun," he said, describing the illness that knocked him on his back for several days.
The data also pointed to numerous schools cited for serious water safety violations, ranging from high lead levels to bacteria exceedances. It showed that the state was powerless to force compliance on uncooperative water companies. It highlighted the state's largest drinking water system for its failure to install filters before the federally mandated deadline.

Just the beginning
The data, of course, was just a starting point. We also did extensive reporting on the emer-gence of the parasite cryptosporidium as a health threat in drinking water and the difficulty in funding new drinking water infrastructure projects.
Finally, the data proved to be the most popular posting to date on our budding electronic bulletin board. We placed a text file listing the violations logged against every water utility in the state so people with a computer could check out their utility's record. The hundreds of calls the first few days practically crashed our modest bbs.
Anyone interested in acquiring the FRDS data should contact Towana Dorsey, at EPA's Free-dom of Information Act Office in Washington.

Thousands of patients get sick every year from infections spread inside hospitais — mainly from health workers' hands. The Tacoma (Wash.) News Tribune examined 1.7 million records from the state Health Department's Comprehensive Hospital Abstract Reporting System.
Thirty-five other states have similar databases. Reporters Adam Berliant and Elaine Porterfield cited several instances where patients died from hospital-borne infections. Even though the health department database did not include patient names, the journalists were able to find those cases by linking the database with a state death certificates. They found likely cases by joining the day, place and cause of death in the two sets of records. The series ran May 28-29, 1995.

State and local databases trace a grim trail
When babies die

By Sarah Christian
NICAR staff

With the right information, the medical community is ripe for computer-assisted re-porting and investigations.
Reporters at the Cleveland Plain Dealer and The New York Times, using very different methods and approaches, found infants and pregnant women are at risk of critical injury and death.
The Plain Dealer used computer databases from the beginning. The reporters said the story would have been impossible to do with-out them. At The New York Times, computer-assisted methods were the final phase of the reporting.
Cleveland reporters Joan Mazzolini and Dave Davis looked at Ohio's system for treat-ing at-risk pregnancies and infants. A state formula gives hospitals designations to ensure that the sickest babies and most at-risk moth-ers are routed to the best medical care. But the reporters found that the system has broken down and that every year hundreds of ex-tremely ill and premature babies are sent to hospitals that may not have the equipment and expertise to care for them.
Using birth certificate databases purchased from the state Department of Health, Mazzolini and Davis were able to identify how many premature babies were born in Ohio in 1992 and 1993, where they were born and where they and their mothers were transferred.
"This really allowed us to question hospi-tals about treating babies not suited to their designation," Davis said. "The thing we really tried to focus on was looking at hospitals treating premature babies they were not equipped for."
Death certificates were integral in identify-ing the babies. Ohio law requires that the names on birth certificates be removed before being released to the public, but names are included in death certificates.
"There was enough matching information to link (the two databases) and figure out names," Davis said. "In matching the birth and death records we identified the babies who had died and were able to find the families. We got some very moving stories. Without the com-puter we couldn't have done that. Matching the birth and death records allowed us to find real people. Some of the stories were amazing."
The series also showed that low-income com-munities are prone to underweight babies.
"It's something we always kind of knew," Mazzolini said. "But it's nice to see it on paper."
Using census information and zip codes from the birth certificates, along with mapping soft-ware, the reporters were able to plot where under-weight babies are born.
The three-month investigation published on Nov. 27, 1994, was "not as difficult as it looks," Mazzolini said. "Reporters need to find out what is in their state's birth certificates. Ohio's turned out to be a wealth of information. You can get great snapshots of your city, county or your state."
Davis advised reporters thinking about tack-ling a similar story to be ready for a fight.
"Hospitals are very powerful institutions. I've taken on a lot of different types of institutions and people, but I think doctors and hospitals are the most powerful I've seen," he said. "We had letters coming in threatening to sue us. And they weren't going to us. They were going to the publisher. That is a sinking feeling. You just have to be prepared for it."

Sign of the times
In New York, reporters Jane Fritsch and Dean Baquet had already uncovered the horror stories of the city's public hospitals before computer-assisted reporting was employed to analyze mor-tality rates.
In a three-part series, "Mismanaged Care: How Public Hospitals Fail," beginning on March 5, 1995, the reporters showed that every year dozens of newborns die or are left to struggle with life-long injuries because they are treated by inexpe-rienced doctors or poorly supervised midwives and aurses in New York City's overcrowded delivery rooms.
The story got started when The Times decided to look at how much litigation was taken against the New York Health and Hospitals Corp., a city agency that runs the public hospitals.
"It quickly became clear that there was some-thing going on in the delivery rooms," Fritsch said.
Court records that allowed the reporters to take a peek at usually-closed hospital records, was

Following the money in medicine
Database uncovers abuse

By Seth Hambiin
University of Missouri

Health care is big business, but that doesn't mean it's a well-run business.
In Georgia, reporters found medical services were done haphazardly. In Florida, journalists uncovered a Medicare system with severe prob-lems. And in both cases, databases were vital to the story.
The Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel examined Medicare HMOs, which are supposed to save patients' money. While these HMOs cover all medical expenses, as opposed to the standard Medicare rate of 80 percent, Medicare HMOs can still be a gamble.
The newspaper found some South Florida Medicare HMOs are half as likely as others to provide access to doctors and hospital services. Seven of these HMOs posted high rates of patients quitting their programs. In some cases, twice as many patients were leaving as were joining. More than 10,800 patients and their families complained about the care to state and federal officials—mainly about the HMOs' not paying their medical bills.
Reporters Fred Schulte and Larry Keller re-quested the Beneficiary Information Tracking System from the U.S. Health Care Financing Administration, but received little cooperation.
"We asked for a tape, but they said, 'Sorry, we can't send it to you that way. We'll send you a hard copy," Schulte recalled. The reporters took the paper records and entered them into a dBase database by hand before analyzing the information with SPSS statistical software.
Schulte said problems with Florida's access laws often leave him building his own data-bases. "Even when I find a database, they won't give it to me," he said.
The work led to a series on Nov. 7-11, 1993, "The HMO Maze: How Medicare Fails Se-niors."
A year after the stories, Schulte teamed with Jenni Bergal for another investigation, "Profits From Pain," on Medicaid HMOs, which ran Dec. 11-15, 1994. Again, the reporters created their own database. This time the records came from the state's HMO peer review board for all hospitals.
"They just collected the data, put it in a box and left it sitting there gathering dust," Schulte said. The reporters became the first to analyze what was in those boxes.
The results showed Medicaid HMOs had dangerously lower standards than private HMOs. At the same time, many Medicaid HMOs were spending much more on administrative and non-medical costs than private HMOs.
The series also showed that 12 of the 15 Medicaid HMOs got "poor" and "very poor" reviews when came to caring for children and pregnant women. These HMOs covered almost all of the 25,000 patients enrolled in Florida's Medicaid system.
In addition, the journalists found nearly 200 of the 300 Medicaid HMO doctors and medical centers failed to meet standards for treatment or proper documentation.
While building the database took the report-ers two to three weeks, the drudgery was worth it, Schulte said. After the series, a state investi-gation ensued, and Florida is considering legis-lation to crack down on health-care abuses.

'In Sickness And In Wealth'
In Georgia, meanwhile, The Atlanta Jour-nal-Constitution found that health care doesn't run by the laws of supply and demand. Instead of medical need, costs are rising because of the number of doctors and hospitals beds.
The newspaper analyzed more than 600,000 health insurance claims and found a wide fluc-tuation in the amount of surgery and hospital care doled out from area to area. It found a seemingly haphazard delivery of medical ser-vices and published the results Sept. 30-Oct. 4, 1990.
In east Georgia, for instance, policy holders were twice as likely to undergo coronary angioplasty, where a balloon-like device is used to widen arteries. There happen to be more cardiologists in east Georgia than in the rest of the state.
The variation in treatment by itself doesn't prove that care is rationed in some places or wasted in others, the Journal-Constitution con-tended. But the newspaper cited experts who said the gaps represent billions of dollars in unnecessary procedures.
Hal Straus, who wrote the stories with Mike King in late 1990 as part of the series "In

After finding gaps in a Centers for Disease Control database that extrapolated cancer rates, Newsday built its own database. The newspaper used U.S. Census records to find 75 similar counties — places with large populations and high development. Bob Tiernan, senior editor for projects, said the newspaper surveyed the health departments for those counties. The results were a key part of reporter Ford Fessenden's story on June 27, 1993, which showed Long Island posted one of the biggest cancer rates.

Newsday also used a New York State Health Department database to examine how area hospitals treated breast cancer with surgery. The Sept. 11, 1994, story revealed a vast difference in the rate of lumpectomies versus mastectomies, including one contro-versial hospital that performed twice as many mastectomies as other facilities in the region.

U.S. News & World Report used the Federal Drug Administration's MedWatch database for a Jan. 9, 1995, cover story that examined drugs with dangerous side effects, including the Norplant birth control implant.
U.S. News' Penny Loeb said the database is "tough to work with," but helped yield a powerful story. The magazine also discov-ered many drugs banned by the FDA are still sold legally over the counter in pharma-cies across the country. That, according to the May 15, 1995, story, includes drugs sold at a Rite Aid located inside FDA headquarters.

Using data from a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Hartford Courant reporter Robert S. Capers Jr. tracked survival rates of transplant recipients at area hospitals. He downloaded the data, which was compiled by the United Network for Organ Sharing, into an Excel spreadsheet. The organ-by-organ, hospital-by-hospital analysis ran March 26, 1995.

central to the investigation, Fritsch said, add-ing that they used the whole spectrum of docu-ment-gathering, from public records to FOIA requests.
"The computer stuff really came at the end," she said. "I resist depending on the computer and I think some other people resist it because you can end up with stories that report the obvious."
Fritsch added, however, that the statistical analysis for Mismanaged Care, gave the re-porters more information to work with, con-firmed hypotheses and "rounded things out."
"The overall point of the computer study was our ability to put into perspective the claims of the city people and the hospital people who said they had more problems be-cause they have a vastly sicker population," Fritsch said. "It turned out the computer study brought that assertion into question."
The reporters had much anecdotal evidence to back up the story and statistical analysis of infant mortality rates done by Josh Barbanel made the narratives difficult to dismiss. Even accounting for such variables as poor prenatal care and the mother's health, the statistics showed infant mor-tality to be significantly higher at public hospitals in the city compared to the private institutions.
While the computer-generated information gave the reporters more ammunition for their story, Fritsch advised reporters wanting to do similar work to avoid the computer at the outset of the investigation.
"Start with sources, with documents, with real people. Otherwise you could end up with some-thing that is theoretical and distant from the subject," she said. "Use the computer to test hypothesis — but develop the hypothesis first."

Sickness and In Wealth," said the idea came from earlier academic studies on prostate sur-gery rates in Connecticut.
"The studies showed a lot of variation, and we wanted to see if the same thing was going on in Georgia," Straus said.
To test the theory, Straus and King needed data from a handful of different sources. They obtained demographic data on Medicare en-rollees, as well as data on the procedures and hospitalization days for these enrollees, from the Georgia Medical Care Foundation. The foundation reviews Medicare spending in Georgia under a contract with HCFA.
For similar data on privately insured pa-tients, Straus and King turned to Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the state's largest insurer.
They fed nine-track tapes from both sources into the newspaper's mainframe computer and, using SAS statistical software, compared it with data on physician and hospital bed supply for various parts of the state. That data came from the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration and the Georgia Hospital As-sociation.
The resulting story shows gaping holes in the state's system of determining when to use medical procedures. Nevertheless, there has been little fallout from their study, Straus said.
"We did the story a couple of years too early," he said. "It would have meant a lot more when there was a big push for health-care reform. But maybe people are more likely now to say to their doctor, 'I don't want this surgery unless it's absolutely necessary.

Medical coverage sites

The health-care insurance debate continues. Here's an array of sites with background infor-mation, key historical documents, statistical re-ports, source lists, and database sellers, that can help you cover this complex and critical issue.
The Health Care Financing Administration's site is full of useful background material. The text to the 1995 Medicare Handbook is there, covering topics such as "What is Medicare?" "What Medicare Does not Pay For," "How to Appeal Medicare Decisions," and "Events That Can End Your Medicare Protection."
There are also other pamphlets, and a help-ful listing of commonly asked questions about Medicare (good for sidebars). There are statisti-cal tables available by state and county, such as "Standardized per capita rates of payment — aged and disabled — parts A and B," which allows quick comparisons between regional Medicare payments. Speeches and press re-leases from the agency, and links to other sites with information related to health care, round out the service. Put this on your bookmark list. http://www.ssa.gov/hcfa/hcfahp2.html

You're on the 'Net or you're nowhere
The U.S. Census Bureau recently started making some of its reports available only on the Internet. The agency's government division began this year by issuing govern-ment finance reports only on-line. That included surveys on state and local government finances, employment and retirement systems. Reporters were also sent short sum-mary sheets. The key reason, according to the Association of Public Data Users, is to save money and get reports out faster. Census may issue some of that information later on CD. The Internet address is http://www.census.gov.
It's not the only agency to take that step. Among the others is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Its quarterly Statistics on Banking is available only on the Internet. So is its Historical Statistics on Banking, 1934-1993. It is also in the process of putting massive databases on its site. The Internet address is http://www.fdic.gov.

St. Pete hires new reporter
The St. Petersburg Times recently hired Brad Goldstein to become its lead computer-assisted reporter. Goldstein, a recent Neiman fellow, had worked at the Lawrence (Mass.) Eagle-Tribune.

Back to school CD
The National Center for Education Statistics has made its data even more user-friendly with a new CD-ROM of the Common Core of Data, 1987-88 through 1992-93. This combines all previously separate data on school enrollment, finances, school district census, staffing and dropouts. It even has Chapter 1 funding, which hadn't previously been available from the agency.
The CD runs in Windows and DOS, and is simple for looking up individual schools and districts. Downloading data for a single district or state is also easy if done as a CSV file. Downloading the entire country might be more difficult.
Neil Mara of the Charlotte Observer used the first version of this CD to do stories on school segregation last year. He cautioned against using the minority percentage calculated on the disk; the enrollment numbers by race seem to be accurate, through. The CD is free right now. Order by calling John Sietsema at (202) 219-1335.

Working overtime with a spreadsheet
The Waterbury (Conn.) Republican-American used a Quattro Pro spreadsheet to examine city payroll records. The analysis by reporter Stephanie Reitz showed dozens of police officers and firefighters nearly doubled their salaries with overtime pay; a legacy of staffing shortages.
The April 23, 1995, story also showed how a 1986 state law designed to attract top teachers — a program later stripped of state funding — meant some of the city's highest salaries went to teachers.
