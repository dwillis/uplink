IN THE NEWS
Mine
safety
stories
By Brian Hamman
IRE and NICAR
In the days and weeks after the
Sago Mine disaster in West Vir-
ginia, journalists used their com-
puter-assisted reporting skills to
dig more deeply into stories about
mine safety.
The U.S. Mine Safety and Health
Administration (MSHA) offers
more than 20 years of accident,
inspection, and violation data on
its Web site that journalists can
use to add context to a quick-hit
story or as the basis of an inves-
tigation.
When they set out to study the
violations at Colorado's mines,
Katy Human and Jeff Roberts of
The Denver Post found they had
to begin with a more basic ques-
tion: "Our first question was, do we
have underground coal mines in
Colorado?" Human says.
To get an overview of mining in
Colorado, Human and Roberts
turned to the data retrieval system
provided by MSHA, available at
www.msha.gov/drs/drshome.htm.

SPOTLIGHT: MONEY & POLITICS
Data lifts lid
on DeLay money
By Jonathan D. Salant, Bloomberg News
Until he stepped down as U.S. House
majority leader in September and then
announced in January that he would
not attempt to reclaim his position,
Rep. Tom DeLay was arguably the
most powerful member of the House
of Representatives.
Even after he was rebuked three times
in 2004 by the House ethics committee,
DeLay had no trouble winning re-elec-
tion to the No. 2 position in the House
Republican leadership.
Only one member of the conference,
Christopher Shays of Connecticut,
called on DeLay to step down in the
face of continuing ethical questions, in-
cluding whether lobbyist Jack Abramoff

MEYER AWARD WINNER
Advanced GIS analysis
targets lost wetlands
By Matthew Waite, St. Petersburg Times
I hadn't been working in the St. Peters-
burg newsroom for more than a month
when Craig Pittman, the environment
reporter at the Times, said he had an
idea he wanted to run past me. He want-
ed to measure the wetlands that had
been destroyed in the past 15 years,
but had no data and no idea how to do
it. I told him it would probably require an
analysis of satellite imagery.
"Can you do it?" he asked.
"Probably," I said, lying through my
teeth. I had no idea if I could do it.
Eventually, I figured it out, and the
answer to Pittman's question was not
so simple. Between 1990 and 2003
– a time when the federal government
pledged to stem the destruction of
wetlands – about 84,000 acres of
Florida's wetlands were replaced by
urban uses; houses, schools, gas sta-

November that the University of
Massachusetts had the highest
rate of violent on-campus crime
among the largest universities in
the United States, based on an
analysis of data by the IRE and

INSIDE NICAR
Yes, we still say
'computer-assisted reporting'
By David Herzog, NICAR and Missouri School of Journalism
A contributor to Poynteronline recently
asked "Does Anyone Still Say 'Computer-
Assisted Reporting'?" in a brief essay that
suggested CAR has gotten as mundane as
using the telephone to gather news.

Well, it hasn't and plenty of journalists still
utter the words "computer-assisted report-
ing" when they are talking about analyzing
data using spreadsheets, database manag-
ers and mapping programs for their news
stories.

It's true that many journalists are tapping
into Web tools to enhance their reporting,
making good use of sites such as Google,
reverse-lookup directories and the local
assessor's online real estate tax rolls.

But many journalists know CAR means
more than effectively scouring the Web for
information. A journalist visiting the U.S.
Mine Safety and Health Administration
Web site would not learn that the agency
lets many of the major fines assessed
against mine operators go unpaid. But
journalists who have obtained MSHA's
enforcement data and analyzed it using
a database manager discovered that
newsworthy piece of information, among
others.

That's what we still call "computer-assisted
reporting."

FIRST VENTURE
Finding surprises
in drug arrest files
By Liz Carey, Community Press (Cincinnati)

Two of hardest things for me to wrap
my mind around at the IRE and NI-
CAR Computer-Assisted Reporting
Boot Camp were how to get the data I
wanted, and what to do with it.

Data analysis is more than taking apart
a spreadsheet, or pawing through a
database. Data analysis, we learned,
is the middle step of a story. You cannot
base a story on the data alone, and you
cannot get the data unless you have the
contacts to get it.

All of this became clear to me when
I returned from the March 2005 Boot
Camp and was chomping at the bit to
find a story to use my newfound skills.

I bought the National Inventory of Dams
database_for_my_state_from..
IRE and NICAR Database
Library and searched through
the IRE Web site for anything
I could make a story out of,
certain I could blow the lid
off something in my Northern
Kentucky beat, despite being
at a weekly newspaper.

Little did I know, the story was
right beneath my feet.

As part of my regular beat,
I regularly wrote up police
reports in the small towns I
covered, transcribing them
from paper to my laptop. I
began to notice an increasing
number of arrests on drug-re-
lated charges.

Cold Spring, Ky., was an ex-
ample of this. Cold Spring, a
city of just more than 4,000,
was named the fastest grow-
ing city in Kentucky in 2004.
The four-lane highway U.S.
27 runs through the middle of
the city, connecting the eastern half of
Northern Kentucky to 1-275, the bypass
that circles Greater Cincinnati.

The city is hardly an urban center, boast-
ing a generally white, upper-middle class
population, with home values in the up-
per-$250,000 range.

I was noticing more frequently that regu-
lar traffic stops in Cold Spring were turn-
ing into drug arrests. Additionally, shop-
lifting charges in the four major grocery
stores were increasing and, more often
than not, the things being stolen could
be used in methadone production.

I decided to take closer look. I didn't find
a smoking gun, but an existing trend that
was being investigated by the police. It

is evidence of the importance of source
relationships.

We started by requesting all of the police
reports since January 2000. At first, the
request was met with a modicum of dis-
belief. In short, the department clerk told
me I was free to go through all 5,000-
plus handwritten reports and take from
them whatever information I wanted.

But the police chief told us that, since
2003, those records were kept in a da-
tabase, and he would be willing to give
them to us on CD.

That data dump took more than an hour,
not in processing time, but in negotiation
over each data category and whether or
not it should be divulged. The process
meant sitting with the chief and discuss-
ing each category in depth, sometimes
giving in, sometimes citing public record
law. There was no charge for the data.

Some categories of data were easily
determined such as age, offense, date
of offense and location of offense. Infor-
mation about name, address, arresting
officer and Social Security number had
to be thoroughly discussed to determine
how essential the information was to our
story, and whether or not it violated any-
one's privacy. In the end, we were able
to get everything, except Social Security
numbers, in a comma-delimited text file
which we imported into a Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet.

I work in a Mac-based newsroom and
Excel was readily available. In addition, I
worked with Excel in the corporate world
before becoming a reporter and it was
easy for me to work with the data that
way and turn over a story quickly, instead
of relearning the Structured Query Lan-
guage also covered in Boot Camp.

The result was a detailed report of
every arrest or citation in the previous
three years that was easily sorted and
manipulated for analysis.

Uplink

That analysis started with breaking down
information by year. Each year's arrests
and citations were then categorized by
type of citation. All those not falling into
a drug category were eliminated from
the table. Then, data was sorted per
citation.

Each citation was sorted by name of of-
fender. Offenders were checked against
one another to make sure that they were
not multiple charges on the same cita-
tion. Additionally, citations were sorted
according to ZIP code to determine
where the biggest number of offenders
was coming from.

The data proved that most offenders
lived in the county, contrary to law en-
forcement professionals' belief that the
majority of the offenders were coming
from outside the county.

Data also revealed offenders came
more from rural areas of the county,

SPOTLIGHT: MONEY & POLITICS
Covering Congress, states
getting trickier
By Derek Willis, The Washington Post

Using computer-assisted reporting to
cover congressional elections used to
be so much simpler.

The Federal Election Commission's
FTP site was the first stop, where pretty
much all of the campaign finance data
you would ever need resided.

Now, thanks to 527 political committees,
state PACs and the 2002 McCain-Fein-
gold campaign finance law, things are
more complicated.

It is no longer enough to limit your data
gathering and analysis to the two or more
candidates in a given congressional or
statewide race. Do that in 2006 and you
could miss the big story, or at least trail
the rest of the pack on it.

While the FEC is still the starting point for
federal races, it is not the finish line. Those
using CAR for elections should assess
the contests they will be covering to see
whether the old boundaries between fed-
eral and state races still apply. If your state
has a hot race, then you will need to know
how to gather data from multiple sources
and integrate it into a single system.

Consider the election for Virginia's attor-
ney general in 2005 (Virginia is one of a
few states that have significant off-year
elections). While Republican and Demo-
cratic candidates raised millions for this
statewide post, the GOP candidate got
more than a third of his money from
a single source: the Republican State
Leadership Committee. Because the
RSLC is a 527 organization reporting
to the Internal Revenue Service, Virginia
regulators and journalists knew only that
it had given a bunch of money to a state
candidate. They did not know where that
money came from and, thanks to the IRS
reporting schedule, they would not find
out until after the election.

Elections in 2006 will see more frequent
disclosure from 527s, which follow a
reporting schedule roughly equivalent to
the FEC in even-numbered years. And
like the FEC, the IRS releases its data
in bulk – meaning that CAR folks will
have to download the entire set of 527
electronic filings and then find the com-
mittees they are after. If you have never
done this before, a little practice wouldn't
hurt. Unlike the FEC, dealing with the IRS
data doesn't require any reformatting of
fields (something you can avoid by pur-
chasing FEC data from the IRE and NI-
CAR Database Library), but it does lump
original and amended filings in the same
compressed file.

Updates are available every Sunday at
http://eforms.irs.gov, and The Center for
Public Integrity also has a regularly up-
dated site that provides downloadable
contributions and expenditures for 527
committees (www.publicintegrity.org/
527).

In federal races, some advertising activ-
ity by 527 committees must be reported
to the FEC, thanks to the McCain-Fein-
gold law. These expenditures, known as
“electioneering communications,” occur
when an organization not registered with
the FEC airs a television or radio ad that
mentions or identifies a federal candidate
within 30 days of a primary election or 60
days of the general election. Such ads fall
under the scope of the law only if they are
targeted to a candidate's constituency; if
the Sierra Club runs an ad about a New
Jersey candidate in Arizona, it would not
meet the criteria.

The good news about electioneering
communication reports is that they in-
clude very specific information about ad
buys, including the stations and amounts
involved, and reports are due within 24
hours of the ad's initial appearance. The
bad news is that those reports are filed by
fax only. For journalists outside Washing-
ton, D.C., that means waiting on the FEC
to scan and post images of those faxes,
which sometimes are difficult to read. It
also means that there is no database of
such activity, unless you decide to build
one (The Center for Public Integrity did
so for the 2004 elections).

This year, state political parties will face
their first real test since McCain-Feingold,
since many of them received an artificial
boost during the 2004 presidential cam-
paign. State parties now find themselves
having to raise and spend mostly federal
or "hard" money, since even the most ge-
neric party activity is presumed to have
some benefit to House and Senate can-
didates on the ballot. So if your state has
a looser reporting schedule, you may find
that the state parties' federal accounts file
more often and contain the bulk of the
money raised and spent. In some cases,
journalists will find more details in the
federal data than is required on the state
level. Beware of duplicative reports – rec-
onciling state and federal data can be a
tricky proposition. When in doubt, call the
treasurer or the party official in charge of
filing the reports for an explanation.

In most respects, the FEC hasn't changed
its data-handling process much; the data
it makes available via FTP is updated
every Monday morning (usually before
5 a.m., for those interested in running
Scheduled Tasks in Windows or cron
jobs on other operating systems. These
files contain all of the contributions as-
sociated with a two-year election cycle
(the current cycle began the day after the
2004 election).

There are ways, however, to avoid work-
ing with the entire set if you are only
focusing on a handful of committees.
All FEC committees, except for Senate
candidates and the two parties' senatorial
fundraising arms, file electronic reports to
the FEC, and those filings can be down-
loaded and used to create databases.
The advantages of doing so are two:
timeliness (you can access a filing as
soon as it appears in the FEC's system)
and the presence of expenditures, which
the FEC does not keypunch or release in

bulk form but are available on a filing-by-
filing basis.

Expenditures are easily the least-cov-
ered aspect of campaign finance, and
sometimes the most important. They
can show the tactics used by campaigns
(direct-mail fundraising or big, flashy
events?) or provide home addresses for
campaign workers. Particularly interesting
are the expenditures of candidates who
face little or no opposition – what do they
spend their money on?

Such reporting can yield great stories, but
if you go this route, remember that you'll
need to keep track of the filings, because
amendments appear often. I've found that
it's useful to track filings themselves, and
you'll probably want to do the same if you
plan to maintain the latest and greatest
version of a committee's data.

The electronic filings end with the file
extension ".fec", but they are delimited
text files that can be imported into Micro-
soft Excel or other programs. But you'll
want to be familiar with the layouts and
keep in mind that each filing contains all
of the transactions associated with that
report: contributions, expenditures and
summary figures, all stacked on top of
each other.

A campaign finance junkie would do well
to keep checking the FEC's FTP site
regularly, however; a the agency often will
place custom collections of data there that
might prove useful.

One last tip, which has been a personal
interest of mine: don't forget the meta-
data. In campaign finance, the metadata
means things like when a committee
reports, how many amendments it files
or even the length of the reports. Such
details are worth tracking because they
can provide insight into the operations
of the campaign. Multiple amendments
filed on the same day are a sure sign that
either the campaign's accountant found a
mistake or the FEC's auditors did. Either
circumstance is worth a look, and may
yield a good story.

OPEN SOURCE
Simplifying database
full-text searches
By Brad Heath, The Detroit News

One of the most important things you
can do in your newsroom is spread the
wealth of information. But finding a way
to let other reporters and editors get the
data they need, whenever they need it, is
a challenge. The easiest way to do it is on
your company's intranet – but most of the
tools are cumbersome or expensive.

Here is my solution.

OpenInfo is a collection of intranet scripts
you can use to run simple, full-text
searches across dozens of newsroom
databases simultaneously. You can add
data to the site with a few minutes of
work, instead of spending hours writing
new search forms. You can customize
it to help people in your newsroom find
information most relevant to them, with
easy searches and automatic cross-ref-
erencing of records. Users who want to
go deeper will find forms they can use
to run advanced searches or write data
queries (without having to know Struc-
tured Query Language).

Best of all, it runs entirely on open-
source platforms (an Apache Web
server, a MySQL database server and
the PHP scripting language). If you
already have the hardware, you can
get the whole package set up in an
afternoon, at no cost. And because it
relies on MySQL to do the heavy lifting,
it can easily accommodate searches of
millions of records. (I have used it on one
server with almost 70 million records
spread across 60 tables.)

Download the OpenInfo file from

Once you provide OpenInfo with basic
information about what kinds of data
are stored in your table, it does the rest:
building search forms, a query wizard
and integrating the records into a global
full-text search.

Once you have the scripts set up (more
on that in a minute), searching is very
straightforward. The home page offers
a single form that will search across ev-
ery database that you incorporate into
OpenInfo, using syntax similar to what
you are accustomed to using for search-
ing the Web or your electronic archives.
(Figure 1) Because the search runs
against a full-text index, you don't need
to know the order in which your search
words appear, or whether they're in the
same field in the database.

In addition to simple searches, OpenInfo
gives you an almost unlimited ability to
drill into and cross-reference your data.
Take, for example, my own voter reg-
istration information. To find it, I'd start
by searching for Heath, Brad* (yes,
OpenInfo supports wildcards), then
click on the matching results to see the
full record. (Figure 2). OpenInfo shows
all the fields incorporated into the data-
base (unless you have chosen to hide
a few), and makes the contents of each
field clickable. Clicking any of the links
will take you to a pop-up guide that will
help you cross-reference that informa-
tion against other OpenInfo records,
Google, or any other online database
with an accessible URL syntax (Yahoo!
News, your archives, your photo assign-
ments, etc.).

If you want, OpenInfo can also do some
of this work for you. For example, you
can teach OpenInfo how to assemble
the fields in your database to make a
complete address. If you do, the script
displays an embedded map for each re-
cord (as well as linking to Google Maps),
and gives you tools for cross-referenc-
ing the address against other records.
It will also automatically check for other
records in that table with a matching ad-
dress and show you a list. That means
when you look at my voter registration
record, OpenInfo automatically finds
my wife's registration, too. (Figure 3).
You also can have OpenInfo mash

together other fields from the record
that you think might be helpful for users
looking to find related information. For
example, it might be helpful to have one
link that will search based on a person's
first name, last name, city and state.

For users who want more power, Open-
Info has more advanced search func-
tions. You can search individual fields in
a database, or use a built-in query grid
to search through or summarize your
data and export the results to Microsoft
Excel (users who want to do even more
can download full data tables as dBASE
files). Users can create custom groups of
sources, or search based on the type of
information associated with a field, such
as names and addresses. If you want,
you can allow users to create their own

[Screenshot of an OpenInfo map result labeled Figure 3]
Figure 3
databases on the fly, for their own use or
to add to the public collection of sources.
OpenInfo tracks searches and record
views so you can find out quickly what is
most popular with your newsroom.

Setup is easy and inexpensive. To start,
you need a MySQL database server,
an Apache Web server and the PHP
scripting language, all of which are open
source. (If you don't already have these,
you can add them fairly easily by down-
loading XAMPP, which installs all three
at once, from http://sourceforge.net/proj-
ects/xampp.) After that, unpack the script
files into one of the folders on your server.
Then sign on to your database server
as a root user and run the setup.sql file
included with the scripts. (You might need
to make a few other adjustments to your
server, depending on how
it's configured. A complete
readme file is included with
the scripts.)

Once the scripts are config-
ured, you need to load your
data tables into MySQL. (Be-
cause it's open source, you
can find a variety of free tools
to help with this; one is at

tions, malls, etc. That figure formed
the backbone of an investigation that
revealed how poorly the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers has enforced the
Clean Water Act.

What did it take to do it? Two college
courses, $5,000 in software, 220 GB
of hard drive space, editors with an
abundance of patience and faith and
about 10 months of free time.

If I haven't scared you off yet, and
you think you might try your hand at
satellite imagery analysis, here's how
we handled the problem of detecting
change with imagery.

The first step in any satellite imagery
analysis is to remember Philip Meyer,
the father of pricison journalism and
a professor at the University of North
Carolina. Meyer has been telling us
that we should use the scientific
method for journalism. With satel-
lite imagery analysis, it is a survival
method. You need to clearly under-
stand your problem and thoroughly
understand your data before starting
your analysis.

Why? Lots of reasons. If you don't under-
stand what you are after, you could spend
months and money analyzing data, only
to come up with nothing. If you misun-
derstand your question, you might buy
the wrong data. That's right: More often
than not, you are going to be buying data.
Some of it is expensive. You do not want
to spend hundreds of dollars on Landsat
imagery only to realize you needed to
spend thousands on SPOT data.

To help you understand your question,
you need to understand what imagery
can show you. For instance, Landsat data
has a resolution of 30 meters — one pixel
in the image equals 30 meters on the
ground. If you're looking for individual
houses, it's the wrong data. If you are
looking at how whole subdivisions have
changed the landscape, you're in the
right place.

You also need to know what data you
need in your imagery. Imagery can
contain just visible light — three bands,
red, green and blue — or it could contain
slices of the infrared spectrum. You need
to know what the bands can tell you and
which bands you need for your analysis.

It's harder than it sounds, and could fill an
Uplink article by itself.

It might seem esoteric to talk about
being sure you understand your own
question, but it's not. It's critical. I
learned the hard way. We originally
set out to find how many acres of
wetlands had disappeared between
1990 and 2003. After months of work,
I had an answer, but it was tens of
thousands of acres beyond what any
of our reporting had found. So I looked
at what we had – a map showing where
wetlands had increased and decreased
between 1990 and 2003. In a few min-
utes, I found the problem – tides. In one
map, the tide was out, in another, the
tide was in. So thousands of acres of
saltwater marshes were gone, but not
really. Other changes were time differ-
ences – one image was taken during
a wetter month than another. All over
Florida, natural changes – rains, tides,
etc. – affect the size of wetlands.

Our question was too simplistic. What
we were really interested in was how
many acres of wetlands man had de-
stroyed permanently.

More on that in a minute.

Obtaining data is both easier and more
difficult in satellite imagery analysis. It
is easier because there are only so
many places you can get it. It is harder
because the ways in which imagery is
stored are a little arcane and, most of
the time, costs money.

Before you buy data, though, ask
around. You might be surprised who
has some and who might be willing to
share. I found a complete 2003 dataset
through a state agency, which made it
free to me under Florida's public re-
cords law. I found a complete Landsat
dataset for the late 1980s through the
University of Maryland's Global Land
Cover Facility. They make imagery from
all over the country freely available to
anyone for download. The upside? It's
free. The downside? It may not be the
time period you want, or they may not
have your area.

If you need something more detailed
than Landsat, it gets more difficult. For
instance, Space Imaging, a the people
who run the Ikonos satellite, will sell you
1-meter high-resolution imagery, but it's
expensive. Many states and the U.S.
Geological Survey do aerial photogra-
phy at 1 meter – USGS will sell it to you
or your state might give it away.

You might be able to avoid paying for
imagery, but you won't duck the soft-
ware price tag. And it's a doozy. Leica
ERDAS IMAGINE, the industry stan-
dard software tool, is $3,500 last time I
checked. Leica makes an extension for
ArcGIS called ArcView Image Analysis.
It is $2,500, and it is the one we went
with, though I regret that now.

Comparing IMAGINE to Image Analy-
sis is like comparing SAS to Excel. The
power difference is huge, and you will
outgrow Image Analysis before you're
done. There are other software pack-
ages, but you don't even want to know
how much they cost.

With software and data, we set out.
The analysis I devised was based
on a half a dozen academic papers I
read that attempted something simi-
lar to the same thing. It's intentionally
simple, and it's called unsupervised
classifications.

(The detailed methodology with bib-
liographic information is available at
www.sptimes.com/2005/05/22/State/
In_depth_methodology.shtml.)

In unsupervised classifications, the
software takes pixels and groups them
together in to classes – clusters of pix-
els of close to the same values. You
can set the number of pixel classes
you want. We went with 100 to give
us maximum flexibility. The trouble with
unsupervised classifications is that the
computer creates the classes but you
have to identify what the class is.

How do you do that? You click. A lot.
Using maps of ancillary data – land-
use maps, road maps, anything you
think will help – you determine that all
the Class 10s fit inside ponds, so you
identify all the Class 10s as ponds.
We kept it simple, identifying things
as wetlands or not wetlands.

After you get some practice, one Land-
sat scene might only take a day's work.
Until then, it can take days. But with
14 Landsat scenes covering Florida,
it was extremely tedious.

After classifying all the imagery twice
– once for each year – you can then
compare them. Image Analysis has a
change detection algorithm built into
it. The algorithm will compare two raw
images, but the work that goes into
comparing raw images is extremely
complex and far beyond this article.
With classified images, the algorithm
will detect where it was once one thing
and is now another.

From there, the analysis gets more
complicated. To answer my question
– to see where wetlands had been
replaced by urban uses – I had to rely
on another dataset, a satellite-derived
map of urbanized areas. It was based
on the same data, so I just totaled up
the acres of area that had been wet-
lands but were now urbanized areas.
To do that, I used another extension,
Spatial Analyst.

Uplink

Spatial Analyst, a $2,500 extension to
ArcGIS, works with raster data, which
is what satellite data is. Spatial Analyst
has powerful tools that are like Excel
for raster data. There are functions and
formulas you can write to get the infor-
mation you need. The syntax is a little
tricky, but the ESRI support reference
is very good.

Our analysis was, in the end, easily
the most complicated work I've ever
done. If you decide to try this, I strongly
urge you to first take college courses
in this. It is well worth the effort and
a tremendous addition to your CAR
toolbox. But it is complex data and not
something you can learn in a tipsheet
or an afternoon class.

I took two remote sensing classes,
which are offered by many large uni-
versities. Many of these introductory
classes are often offered for those
who are getting geography degrees,
and the advanced courses are often
graduate level.

an employment table with details about
the number of employees, the amount of
production, mine type and other informa-
tion, and an incident table with details
about each injury and illness, including a
narrative of the incident and information
about the experience, shift and job title
of the person involved. Data is available
for 1983-2004.

By joining the employment table with the
injury table, it is possible to calculate an
injury rate for each mine, as well as a
national average. Once you have identi-
fied mines of interest, however, you will
need to turn to the data retrieval system
to view citations and fines.

Much of the attention following the
Sago Mine focused on the time it took
the first rescue team to begin work. Ward
reported in The Gazette that a rescue
team did not enter the mine until almost
12 hours after the explosion.

To add depth to the story, Ward used
a nationwide list of mine rescue teams
available from MSHA from the mine
rescue link off the home page, or
www.msha.gov/MineRescue/MAP/
ASP/minerescuehome.asp. The data
comes as an Excel file with a row for
each rescue team nationwide. The
columns include number of members,
the type of activities, the number of
monthly training hours, and whether
the team participates in mine rescue
competitions.

By combining the rescue team data with
other MSHA data, Ward was able to re-
port there was only one rescue team for
every four mines nationwide.

Human and Roberts caution journalists
to be careful to note what dates are in-
cluded in their analysis. Since MSHA up-
dates its data retrieval system frequently,
summary information such as violations
and accident totals can change through-
out the reporting of the story.

To get acquainted with the terminology
and regulations associated with the min-
ing industry, Ward recommends several
sources, including the Pennsylvania De-
partment of Environmental Protection
mining glossary (www.dep.state.pa.us/
dep/deputate/minres/dms/website/
training/glossary.html) and the U.S.
Code of Federal Regulations, which is
available from the MSHA home page.
Ward also recommends obtaining un-
derground mining textbooks through
interlibrary loan at your local library.

In addition to the textbooks, some
colleges offer mining programs. The
faculty there can provide another
resource. Tomich drew on the experi-
ence of a local mining professor to
help him explain the differences be-
tween the amounts mines were fined.

network analysis at www.ire.org/sna).

When the data was imported in UCI-
NET as a text file and drawn for the
first time in the program's NetDraw
graphing application, it proved to be
quite a monster. Social network types
sometimes refer to this as the "hairball"
– and it was quite a hairball.

Despite the visual mess, the analysis
functions of UCINET allowed us to
calculate who within our hairball held
the most power in terms of a number of
factors, such as "closeness,” “centrality"
and other terms which basically all are
variation of the same question: who
wields the most influence?

But displaying the information visually
so that the relationship could actually
be seen and understood within the net-
work was our goal. And that was simply
impossible with close to 1,000 ties.

While there are ways to work with the
data in UCINET, we found it easier to
pare down the data in FoxPro, where
our master table resided, and then
import the results back into UCINET
for analysis.

As the peripheral relationships were
slowly peeled away, we could begin
to see the web of connections that
formed the true core of Richmond's
power structure. The results were strik-
ing. The boards were even more inter-
locked than we had originally surmised.
A couple of organizations shared so
many directors that they were almost
indistinguishable from each other. And
a core group of the city's powerful and
wealthy seemed to have their hands in
all the right pots.

Richmond's "good-old-boy" network
was coming to light. While many people
had already suspected who the major
players were, even they were surprised
to see just how intertwined the relation-
ships were.

We still faced a few challenges. The
most notable one involved Richmond's
mayor.

Richmond had just elected a mayor,
the former governor of Virginia, L.
Douglas Wilder. He had come in bear-
ing the torch of reform, claiming he
would clean up city hall after years of
corruption and abuse. But in doing so
he had advocated for a change in the
city's charter that would grant the mayor
sweeping new powers. With those pow-
ers in hand, his influence was being felt
across the city.

While Wilder did not fit into the network
of interlocking boards, to totally ignore
him would not be a viable option either
for a project focused on power brokers
within the city. So to bring him into the
mix, reporters gathered data on cam-
paign contributions to his mayoral race,
and entered them into the database.

At first, we tried simply to include Wilder
as his own "organization" – the Wilder
Campaign, so to speak. Those already
in the 1,000-record main data table who
had contributed to Wilder were given a
new connection – to the Wilder node.

However, it became evident this ap-
proach was not going to work. First, be-
cause it was easier to make campaign
contributions than to be appointed to a
board of directors, Wilder's prominence
in the network was exaggerated when
added to the mix in UCINET. He had
more ties than even the most connected
directors. And even more crucially, the
logic of the visual network map was that
a tie between a person and a board or
foundation translated to "is a director of."
The ties to the Wilder campaign did not
mean the same thing.

To solve this, we instead decided to
display our nodes differently, showing
whether the node was an organization,
an individual who gave to the campaign,
or an individual who did not contribute. In
UCINET you can create data attributes
that NetDraw can later use to create
distinct symbols. We used blue squares
for organizations, red circles for individu-
als who contributed to Wilder and green
circles for all other individuals.

The result was a network map that
showed a substantial buy-in from
the city's connected and powerful to
Wilder's campaign.

After some other final changes, the vi-
sual "spider web" representation of the
city's interlocking directorates helped
guide even more reporting for the
project, and the months of digging by
reporters came to fruition in a Sunday
package of stories that had even some
longtime residents shaking their heads
at just how pervasive the good-old-boy
network still was.

The network graphic that appeared in
the paper was also accompanied by
a series of interactive images on the
Times-Dispatch's Web site.

not within range of the sirens.

Drug arrests

than from the more urban areas. Those
arrested were more likely to be mid-20s
to mid-30s, instead of college-aged chil-
dren coming from Cincinnati or nearby
Northern Kentucky University as many
law enforcement officials previously
thought.

Because of space considerations, much
of that information was not used in the
final story.

After culling the data down to the
essential information, saving each
spreadsheet along the way, we were
able to track the increase, however
slight, over the three years covered in
numbers and types of drug arrests and
citations.

That is where the story started, not
ended.

At the same time, our law enforcement
sources were telling us that area police
officers were looking into the same
things we were.

As it turned out, police officers in
Campbell County, Ky., were working
to clamp down on drug use along the
same stretch of highway where we had
noticed problems.

A six-week sweep netted 70 busts for
drug possession and use. It was the
anecdotal evidence that helped make
the story come alive.

Highland Heights Police Chief Carl Mul-
len, who organized the sweep, said the
problem stemmed from users traveling
south from Cincinnati, as well as from
residents from every municipality in the
county.

"I was surprised at the number arrested;
we all were actually," Mullen said. "We
knew it was a problem. But we didn't
know how big of a problem it was."

Mullen said arrests included pregnant
women, social workers, students and
even mothers with their children in the
car with them.

"It was all walks of life. It's not isolated to
any class," he said. "We had one where
a girl had told us that she at one point
had a $400-a-day habit. When she was
approached, she didn't have any drugs
on her, but she admitted to us that she
had an addiction problem."

One officer talked about arresting a
woman for shooting up heroin in her car
while driving her children to day care.

Our examination of the trends showed
that while there was a 17 percent in-
crease in the number of arrests made
for drug-related offenses in Cold Spring
alone, there was a staggering 146 per-
cent increase in arrests made for pos-
session of a controlled substance.

Campbell County police continue to
work together, nearly nine months later,
on controlling the flow of drugs through
the area.

In the words of Mullen, what happened
over those six weeks is just the tip of
the iceberg.

"We got 70 people," he said. "How many
others do you think are out there?"
