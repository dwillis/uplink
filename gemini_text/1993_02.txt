A deadly cure
Analysis of Nuclear Regulatory data
reveals realities of radiation treatment

By DAVE DAVIS and TED WENDLING
The Cleveland Plain Dealer

As a daily assignment, the spill of
radioactive phosphorus-32 inside
a research laboratory at the
Cleveland Clinic wasn't much — a 12-
inch story inside. But clinic officials
refused to identify a nearby music
school that had been contaminated in
the incident. They issued a challenge:
file a Freedom of Information Act
request and try to get the name from
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

We did. And more than 1000 FOIA
requests later, we wrote "Lethal Doses —
Radiation That Kills," a five-day series
that was published by The Plain Dealer in
December.

The series could not have been done
without access to the NRC's online
database NUDOCS. We spent hundreds
of hours searching and analyzing the 2
million records on NUDOCS, looking
for leads on radiation accidents and
victims.

The resulting stories documented the
failure of the NRC to protect the public
from radiation overexposures and
accidents in our nation's hospitals.
When we asked NRC officials how many
people had died from medical over-
doses of radiation, they knew of none.
We found more than 40, including two
that we identified on the agency's
NUDOCS system.

Among the dead was Dwight
Golstein, a 9-year-old who died of
radiation-induced respiratory failure in
1988 after receiving double-doses of
cobalt-60 radiation at Alta Bates Medical
Center in Berkeley, Calif. Golstein was
undergoing treatments for a tumor in
his sinus cavity.

The radiation was a slow killer. After
a few months, Dwight's dark skin turned
jet black and began to peel, spinal fluid
drained from his right ear and his
swollen tongue forced its way out of his
mouth.

It was as if Dwight had been in an
atomic bomb blast. His mother, Bar-
bara, watched him die.

"I made sure to hug and kiss him,"

Golstein told us. "Dwight's face was
disfigured, and his tongue was so fat he
looked like a little monster. He really
looked grotesque and he knew it, but I
wanted him to know that we loved him."

Dwight's final days are etched forever
into his mother's memory.

"I told Dwight before he died that it
was OK to leave us," Golstein told us.
"He was fighting hard. I told him that he
was going to go to heaven and live with
Jesus and that it was better for him. ...
Three days later, he died."

When we asked the California Bureau
of Radiological Health if anyone there
knew of Dwight's death, officials said no.
They then went to the hospital, where
they were told that no overdose has
occurred. After reading the series,
California officials visited the hospital
again. This time Alta Bates officials
admitted that they had not been truthful
with the agency. A criminal investigation
is now underway into what state officials
openly call a coverup by the hospital.

And Alta Bates is not unique. We
found many hospitals where radiation
safety has been under-funded, neglected
and, in some places, openly scorned. We
found doctors and nuclear medicine
technicians who had overdosed patients,
sometimes deliberately, and then
falsified records and lied to regulators to
cover up. And we probed the NRC's
shameful investigation of the nation's
most serious medical radiation catastro-
phe, the overexposure of 413 cancer
patients who died, and the NRC didn't
bother to find out what happened to
them.

Many of the patients suffered from
terminal cancers. For them, the radia-
tion overdoses of up to 41 percent left
wounds that would not heal and has-
tened their demise. But many victims,
such as 25-year-old Edna Gail Valentine,
an elementary school teacher, were
expected to survive their cancers.

Edna was 4 1/2 months pregnant with
her first child when she began radiation
treatments that were meant to kill any
lingering cells left after surgery for

Hodgkins Disease. Four months later, both
she and the unborn baby were dead.

Her sister, Barbara Hoover, and scores of
other families of victims say they were told
nothing by hospital and NRC officials.

"They burned her lungs," said Hoover,
after reading an NRC report that had not
been made available to the family. "They lied
to us. They knew what happened all along,
and they didn't tell us."

Hoover said she would never forget the last
time she spoke to her sister. She had received
a call at the school where they both taught. By
the time she reached the hospital, they were
wheeling Edna into emergency surgery.

"She told me she was afraid," Hoover said.
"I said, 'Yeah, I would be too. But everything
will be fine. We'll see you when you get out.' "
Edna never awoke from the surgery.

After reading about Riverside, NRC
Chairman Ivan Selin said he didn't realize
what the victims and their families went
through. "We haven't helped them and we
really should," Selin said. Later, in comment-
ing on their series, he said: "If two reporters
can work for a few months and come up with
what you got, that's a pretty good indication
that we're not doing our jobs." Selin prom-
ised major reforms in the agency's medical
programs.

Acquiring information
from the Nuclear
Regulatory Commissi

By DAVE DAVIS
The Cleveland Plain Dealer

Our series on radiation mishaps in hospitals
found numerous flaws with the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, but an unwilling-
ness to provide information was not among them.

The best proof of this I can offer is the
agency's online database NUDOCS, an invaluable
source of information for reporters who cover the
environment, or who occasionally write about
hospitals, universities, nuclear power plants,
radioactive waste or other related issues.

NUDOCS, agency lingo for Nuclear Document
System, holds more than 2 million records
gathered by the NRC since 1978.

Within about a week of issuing inspection
reports, technical studies, fines and special
investigations, NRC officials have the information
summarized and entered on the NUDOCS
system. NUDOCS also is an excellent source for
correspondence, reports and other records
generated by other federal and state agencies, as
well as outsiders such as environmental groups,
concerned citizens and reporters.

For example, a search for records that r
"Ohio" brings up 2,010 hits. Plug "death" or
"killed" into the NUDOCS search menu and 426
records appear. NUDOCS has 10,141 records
generated by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, 46 by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
and 19 by Vice President Al Gore.

There are 21 records, mostly Freedom of
Information Act requests, for which I am listed as
the author.

NUDOCS also holds congressional correspon-
dence and transcripts of hearings and important
meetings.

Because NUDOCS offers only summaries of
documents - ranging from a few sentences to
dozens of pages in length - it must be used in
conjunction with the NRC's Public Documents
Room, which holds the actual records. With the
document accession number retrieved from
NUDOCS, you can call the Public Document
Room's reference desk at (202) 634-3273 and get
the records by fax or by mail. The cost is five cents
a page.

There is no cost for searching NUDOCS. The
NRC doesn't charge for time on the system and
the call that connects you is to a toll-free 800
number.

And while NUDOCS was created for use by
NRC officials and the libraries that serve as NRC
repositories, you can get access. To request a
password, simply write to: Gerald F. Cranforo.

'TRAC'ing more complete NRC data

By DAVID BURNHAM and SUSAN LONG
AC Syracuse University

In recent years, federal agencies such as the
Environmental Protection Agency and the
Census Bureau have been making computer-
ized databases public.

While these "hand out" databases can provide
reporters important, useful information, most of
the data files available through federal agencies
focus on external situations, and not on the
internal workings of agencies.

The central mission of the Transactional
Records Access Clearinghouse is to obtain com-
puterized records of federal enforcement agencies
and transform them into databases that reveal
what these agencies actually are doing.

The TRAC Nuclear Regulatory Commission
database, for example, covers the regulation of
nuclear power reactors from 1975 to August of 1989.
(TRAC currently is updating this database.) The
database is available in various formats: a six-volume
report series, diskettes suitable for use on either PC or
MacIntosh computers and nine-track computer tape.

TRAC's first step in gathering the NRC data was
to obtain a list of the dozens of record systems
then used by the NRC. We decided initially to
focus on what the NRC called its "766" file. TRAC
vested this file under the Freedom of Informa-
Act. The massive file, with millions of different
tries, was reproduced on a tape that we provided
for the agency.

Obtaining the raw 766 file was only the begin-
ning of the long process of developing what we
call a "knowledge base," an organized collection of
information that allows the user to examine the
workings of an agency. Although the 766 file
contains details of NRC inspections undertaken at
both commercial power plants and other licensed
facilities such as universities and hospitals, TRAC
decided to focus its attention on the 130 commer-
cial plants which came under NRC regulation
from its formation in 1975 through August of
1989.

There were, however, a lot of problems. The
NRC only provided the sketchiest information on
the format and file contents of the tape, and most
of the specific codes were not defined. In cases
where codes were defined, they didn't always
match the information in the file.

The file contained detailed information such as
where and when each inspection was conducted,
how long it required to complete, who conducted
it and whether the inspection resulted in the
operator being cited for any violations. From 1975-
89 for power plants only, the data indicated that
the NRC conducted close to 50,000 inspections
detected about 27,000 violations.

The NRC's records are surprisingly inconsistent,
sometimes showing that a single reactor became
operational on several different dates. An accurate
list of the name of each commercial nuclear power
plant, the utility that owned it and the exact date it
was granted its pre-construction license, its
construction license, when it became operational
and when it was permanently closed down had to
be compiled by TRAC to make the 766 file useful.
The inconsistencies in the data required double
checking the information with the NRC and, in
some cases, with the utilities themselves.

The purpose of this intense effort was to
provide more than just NRC information about
individual reactors. The TRAC data also presents
the information in terms of the periods that each
reactor goes through during its total life. With
TRAC data, it is possible to determine whether an
individual reactor had more or fewer violations
during the construction period than it did during
its operational period.

The basic accuracy of the NRC data, however,
was not the only problem. NRC had changed the
way it categorized the seriousness of violations
several times — starting with a three-category
system, moving to a six-category system in the early
eighties, and then back to a five-category system.
Spotting these changes, not documented any-
where in the raw 766 file, was critical.

We also sought to locate information about
what the NRC did after the inspector detected a
violation, the place where the 766 file left off.
When were penalties assessed, how big were they,
against whom were they applied? No one we
talked to at the NRC knew of any computerized
information on penalties, so TRAC reluctantly
began building its own computerized files drawn
from internal paper records.

Very late in this process, TRAC discovered that
the NRC did in fact have such a file — the En-
forcement Action Tracking System (EATS) which
was not widely known within the NRC. We
obtained EATS under the FOIA. But EATS used a
different identification system than the 766 file.
The file that TRAC developed from the paper
records supplied cross-linking "IDs" so that
violations and penalties could be matched.
Comparison of these two independent sources of
information on penalties allowed further checks
of NRC data accuracy.

Knowing the precise number of violations at a
particular plant can be interesting. But developing
information so that a user can compare the
performance of one utility against that of another
or determine whether NRC inspectors around the
country are enforcing regulations in a uniform
way transforms a normal "database" into a "knowl-
edge base," a tool that can provide genuine
insights into both the workings of an important
federal agency and the industry it regulates.

TRAC, a non-profit organization, was founded by
Burnham, a former New York Times reporter, and
Long, a professor of quantitative methods at
Syracuse. For more information about TRAC, call

Taking bytes out of the education apple

By DIANNA BORSI
MICAR
University of Missouri

Child molesters for teachers. Felons driving
the school bus. Racism manifesting itself
with more minority students in remedial
classes and fewer in gifted programs.

Education stories like these can be done
without years of training or rooms full of com-
puter equipment.

Joel J. Smith, an investigative reporter at the
Detroit News, used nine-track tape to compare
Michigan's Department of Corrections database of
550,000 convicted criminals with a Michigan
Department of Education database of 97,000
school teachers and 15,000 school bus drivers.

He found roughly 200 convicted felons in the
classrooms with another 200 driving school buses.
Charges ranged from murder to child molesta-
tion. Weighing the right to privacy against the
responsibility to protect students, Smith pointed to
one case in particular: One teacher convicted of
molesting a 15-year-old girl served his time, went
and taught in another state, returned and was
rehired — once again dealing with young girls.
"Shouldn't the school district know about this?
They didn't," Smith said.

The Department of Education claimed it
checked for criminal records. Later the Depart-
ment admitted it only checked when applicants
for a teaching certificate admitted they'd been
convicted of a felony. But when Smith looked at
applications, he found that "in every single case,
they lied."

After the initial computer match, many names
were culled by gender or by first and last name
checks. Smith used a stand-alone IBM for the
initial matches which turned up the 400 names.
With the information copied onto a diskette, he
put it on an IBM PC and used Paradox software.

Smith also checked his computer matches
using old-fashioned reporting. "I never ran a
name that I didn't manually look up and verify if it
was the same person. I talked to virtually every
person I used," Smith said. In some cases, he
simply sent them a letter, and they contacted him.

The final results? Michigan enacted a safe-
guard law and criminal checks are now run on all
schoolbus drivers and teachers.

Dallas Morning News reporter Joseph Garcia
found 200 school employees with felony convic-
tions that no one knew about. Using tapes, Garcia
compared the Dallas Independent School
District's payroll records with Dallas County
Prosecutor data, which contains demographics,
the criminal charge and its disposition.

In one case, a custodian was fired when he
stopped showing up for work. Garcia discovered
the missing janitor was in jail for murder.

Along with dozens of drug offenses, the search
turned up three sexual offenders. Garcia discovered in two cases that judges had ruled that
employers — the school district — didn't have to
be told.

Again, the applications had asked about
convictions, but "by and large, a the people just out-
and-out lied," Garcia said.

Not every successful computer-assisted educa-
tion story starts with a tape.

Using XDB on a home computer and informa-
tion provided on diskette, Reagan Walker of the
(Jackson, Miss.) Clarion-Ledger found that test
scores more closely correlated with the basic
poverty level of a school than expenditures per
pupil.

Walker looked for correlations using informa-
tion furnished by the State Department of Educa-
tion on diskette for a mere $250. The data in-
cluded test scores by district, school expenditures
by pupil, the worth of a mill per district and the
number of courses offered by each high school.

She found a strong correlation between the
poverty level and low test scores, high dropout
rates and low ACT scores. But Walker wanted to
know why.

After analyzing the data, she concluded that
schools that had less money offered fewer high
school courses and less resources to their students.
This in turn meant students scored lower on ACT
tests and had fewer opportunities for higher
education.

Aleta Watson, with nine years of experience on
the education beat, uses Microsoft EXCEL spread-
sheets on a Macintosh to bring data together and
make comparisons.

Her paper, the San Jose Mercury News, covers an
area that includes nearly 50 school districts. But
there is no central repository of education data for
the area. Spreadsheets help her draw together
information from the various districts and make
comparisons.

In 1987 she looked at asbestos in the schools.
Loading information from each district into the
computer, she discovered how many schools had
removed the substance, where asbestos remained,
whether it is in classrooms or other areas and what
proportion of the schools have asbestos.

A spreadsheet can also reveal hidden segrega-
tion. In 1991 Watson used a spreadsheet to look at
a school five years after a desegregation court
order and found that Hispanics were still more
likely to be in remedial classes and less likely to be
in advanced placement classes. In building this
database, Watson also discovered that half of all
Hispanic students have had a D or an F on their
report card.

Watson also looked at administrative costs of
each district as a percentage of its budget. "It was
pretty shocking. Administration wasn't that big
chunk (of the budget)," Watson said. Despite
solid numeric evidence, "People still called and

Tech tips
Secrets of the superprogrammers

BY DAN WOODS
The News & Observer
Raliegh, N.C.

Decades ago, in the datazoic era of the 1960s
and 1970s, huge mainframes ruled the
earth. Behemoths they were, cared for by a
priesthood of superprogrammers, who loved to
compress every field of every record into the
smallest number of bits.

After the personal computer enlightenment in
the early 1980s, memory became cheap and
processors exploded with power. In this era, ease
of use became more important than efficient
storage.

The relational database revolution sprang from
the premise that the method for asking questions
should be independent of the way the data is
stored. Structured Query Language was born to
help people ask questions of data in an organized
way. Instead of the compressed and Byzantine
ways superprogrammers stored data, relational
databases are stored in flat files, most of it in
character form.

With a relational database, asking a new
question means writing a new SQL statement. In a
oic database, asking a new question meant
ing the superprogrammer to write a new
program. Superprogrammers loved this.

For the most part, the superprogrammers have
fossilized, and no longer are able to make life
difficult for the rest of us. They still exist, though,
and frequently surface in state government
bureaucracies, which have resisted for years
competitive pressures that drove businesses to
modernize. In this environment, data tends to be
crammed together in wonderfully creative ways.

Superprogrammers must be given their due.
Their methods stored the most data in the least
space. One of the favorite techniques used by
superprogrammers is using bit flags to store
Boolean or logical variables. This is elegant
because logical variables are those that can be
either true or false, bits can be 0 or 1 — a perfect
match. It is efficient because one byte can store 8
bit flags. In the era of P.C. enlightenment, one
logical variable takes up one byte, which is no
problem because storage abounds.

Superprogrammers also would store numbers
such as dates in portions of integers. I recently
encountered a two-byte date field that had the
following format:
Bits 0 through 7 were the year
Bits 7 through 10 were the month
Bits 11 through 15 were the day
(he bits are numbered from 0 to 15 starting at
tiit.)
This is a super-compact way to store dates. Each
date is stored in a two-byte integer, rather than in
a six-byte string of characters, like most dates (i.e.,
YYMMDD).

Despite their efficiency, these fields are an
unholy nuisance! Unless you write Assembly
Language code, the lingua franca of the
superprogrammer, (or it's modern equivalent, C)
it seems that bit flags or two-byte dates will be
impossible to use with a language like FoxPro,
Paradox or XDB.

Fear not, however. Such fields are accessible to
those unskilled in the ways of the superprogram-
mers. For even though superprogrammers can
squish data together in ingenious ways, they cannot
stop numbers from being numbers, and therein lies
the solution.

A byte that contains 8 bit flags, for example, is
a number from 0 to 255. If we look at the first 16
values in binary, hexadecimal and decimal
notation, we can see a way out of our dilemma.

Binary       Hex. Dec. Bit 7 on Bit 6 on Bit 5 on
0000 0000    00     0
0000 0001    01     1        x
0000 0010    02     2                  x
0000 0011    03     3        x         x
0000 0100    04     4                            x
0000 0101    05     5        x                   x
0000 0110    06     6                  x         x
0000 0111    07     7        x         x         x
0000 1000    08     8
0000 1001    09     9        x
0000 1010    0A    10                  x
0000 1011    0B    11       x         x
0000 1100    0C    12                            x
0000 1101    0D    13       x                   x
0000 1110    0E    14                  x         x
0000 1111    0F    15       x         x         x

(Remember the bits are numbered from 0 to 7,
starting at the left. Also, in hexadecimal A = 10, B =
11 etc. up to F = 15.)

How do we determine if an individual bit of this
character is 0 or 1? First, treat the byte as a num-
ber. In FoxPro that means reading the byte in as a
one-character field, then using the ASC function
to translate it to a number. The number field will
have to be 3 bytes long in FoxPro, because 8 bits
can store a number from 0 to 255.

If we look at the byte as a number we can see
some interesting things. Bit 7, the rightmost bit, is
on — meaning 1 — when the number is odd, and
off — meaning 0 — when the number is even. Bit
6, the second from the right, is on when the
remainder after dividing the number by 4 is
greater than 1. Bit 5 the third from the right, is on
when the remainder after dividing by 8 is greater
than 3. Bit 4 is on when the remainder after
dividing by 16 is greater than 7.

Another way of talking about the remainder of

number y is to use the term modulus. Number x
modulus y is the remainder of x after dividing the
number by y. If x is less than y then x is the same as
its modulus with respect to y. In FoxPro this
function is written MOD(x,y). MOD(7,4)=3 because
7 has a remainder of 3 after being divided by 4.
MOD(8,16) = 8 because 8 has a remainder of 8 when
divided by 16. MOD(4,2) = 0 because 2 divides evenly
into 4.

We can then write the following FoxPro IF THEN
statements to decode the bit flags in a single byte
field called BITFLAG:

IF MOD(BITFLAG, 2) > 0 THEN Bit 7 is on
IF MOD(BITFLAG, 4) > 1 THEN Bit 6 is on
IF MOD(BITFLAG, 8) > 3 THEN Bit 5 is on
IF MOD(BITFLAG, 16)>7 THEN Bit 4 is on
IF MOD(BITFLAG, 32)>15 THEN Bit 3 is on
IF MOD(BITFLAG, 64)>31 THEN Bit 2 is on
IF MOD(BITFLAG, 128)>63 THEN Bit 1 is on
IF MOD(BITFLAG, 256)>127 THEN Bit 0 is on

This code will leave any number of bit flags a
smoking ruin. We use the same technique to
decode the compact dates, which are stored as
follows in a two-byte, unsigned binary integer we'll
call TWOBDATE. When stored as a binary number,
TWOBDATE has the following structure:

yyyyyyymmmmddddd

where y are bits indicating the year, m indicate the
month, and d the day.

TWOBDATE is converted from a two-byte integer
to a FoxPro decimal number using Nine Track
Express or some other tape conversion utility. The
FoxPro number would have to be five bytes wide
because two bytes, or 16 bits, can store a number
from 0 to 65535.

The year field is stored in bits 0 through 7. That
leaves 9 bits of the 16-bit number remaining. Nine
bits can store a number from 0 to 511. The year bits,
in essence, are storing the number of 512's in the
16-bit number. (That's equivalent to the three
leftmost digits of a 9-digit decimal number storing
the number of millions.) To find out the number of
512's in the number we take the number, subtract
its remainder with respect to 512, and then
by 512. Thinking of this in millions rather
512's may make it clearer. The number of millions
in a number is the number minus the first 6 digits,
divided by a million. This formula extracts the year
from the first 7 bits:

year=(TWOBDATE-MOD(TWOBDATE,512))/512

We handle the next two fields in a similar
fashion. For the month, bits number 8 to 11, we
note that there are 5 bits to the right, which can
store from 0 to 31. That means the 8th to 11th bits
are counting the number of 32's in the number. We
eliminate bits 0 to 7 by taking the number modulus
512. The formula to extract the month is therefore:

month=(MOD(TWOBDATE,512)-MOD(TWOBDATE,32))/32

The day is easy. We simply take the number
modulus 32.

day = MOD(TWOBDATE,32)

Putting this all together with other FoxPro
functions to convert the entire two-byte date into a
FoxPro date, we come up with the following
command:

REPLACE ALL FOXDATE WITH
CTOD(STR((MOD(TWOBDATE,512)-MOD(TWOBDATE,32))/32)+"/"+STR((TWOBDATE-MOD(TWOBDATE,512))/512,2,0))

Take that, superprogrammers!

she said.

Jonathan Eig of the Dallas Morning News
used spreadsheets to prove racial lines still
exist in school. But in this case, Eig used
information that was gathered by the
federal government but not yet analyzed
and released.

"We scooped the agency," Eig said.

area in remedial and gifted classes,
corporal punishment and graduation
rates.

But while the Department requires all
schools to gather the information, it
collects information from only a few. To
obtain the data for this award-winning
1991 series, Eig had to write Freedom of
Information letters to the Department
and various schools in his district.

Then, using a spreadsheet, he
proved a great gulf still divides students.

For example, he found that at
schools with predominantly black
students, teachers had less experience
and few had master's degrees. He also
found that the numbers of minorities in
remedial classes were up while the
numbers of minorities in gifted and
talented classes were down — and that
minorities got corporal punishment
more often. This held true for blacks
and Hispanics but not Asians.

Looking at the information by district,
he discovered that the oft-criticized
Dallas Independent School District was
more even-handed than suburban
schools in many ways. In suburban
schools, minorities were more likely to
end up in special education classes.

The articles sparked a parents
movement and started people talking
about the issue, Eig said.

Reporters don't have to be computer
experts or full-time investigative report-
ers to turn out hard-hitting computer-
assisted education stories. Even begin-
ning reporters can deal with data that
would stump a reporter without a
computer.

Bits, bytes and nibbles

Journalists frequently call MICAR to ask:
"How do I know what databases are out there?"

While the government spends a lot of money
maintaining its databases, it makes little effort to
tell the public what's available.

Two places to start looking are the Federal
Database Finder and the State Database Finder
by Mathew Lesko. These sources scratch the
surface.

However, once you understand the philoso-
phy behind CAR — that every government
agency, from the federal to the local level, which
maintains computer records has, in essence, an
obtainable electronic database — you get an
appreciation for how difficult it is to come up
with a comprehensive listing.

But it looks like reporters in Minnesota might
get lucky.

Andris Straumanis, a doctoral candidate at the
University of Minnesota's school of journalism,
has been cataloguing some of the more than
2,000 databases located in state government
agencies throughout Minnesota.

The Minnesota Database Directory, tentatively
set for publication in the spring of 1993, is
designed specifically to be a reference tool for
journalists.

The idea for the directory arose out of two
conferences on the use of electronic public
records hosted by the Minnesota Journalism
Center. Maybe journalism professionals and
students in the other 49 states could get together
and do the same.

The News & Record in Greensboro, N.C.,
recently won a victory in the ongoing battle for
access to computerized information.

This month a judge finally ordered Guilford,
N.C., county officials to turn over to reporters
property tax listings stored on computer tape.

The News & Record first sought access to the
records last March but balked when county
officials said the 164,000 records would cost
$8,200.

"They were asking a nickel a record, which
was the same cost they charge for individual
paper records," said Lex Alexander, investiga-
tive/database reporter for The News & Record.

When The News & Record challenged the cost,
county officials changed their tune and argued
the records weren't public at any price.

On Feb. 5, a judge rejected the county's
argument that making the records public would
violate state law prohibiting public officials from
using information about individual income.
The judge did not, however, settle the issue of cost.

"The agreement is a little weird," said
Alexander. "They will give us a copy of the tape
now, and if the court rules the cost is some price
we don't want to pay, we return the file."

North Carolina Public Records Law includes
electronic records but does not clearly define
what constitutes "reasonable cost," said
Alexander.

The Freedom Forum and Arizona State
University's Walter Cronkite School of Journal-
ism are sponsoring the fourth annual seminar for
reporters and editors in computer-assisted
journalism March 4-6.

Morning sessions will feature nationally
known journalists, including Donald Barlett, two-
time Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter
and coauthor of the Philadelphia Inquirer series
"America: What Went Wrong;" Larry Sanders,
database editor of USA Today, John Ullmann,
former projects editor of the Minneapolis Star-
Tribune.

Afternoons will be devoted to hands-on work
with online databases, CD-ROM and 9-track
tapes.

The seminar is open to newspaper staffs in
Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah and
Nevada, but other applicants will be considered if
space is available.

For more information contact Ed Sylvester at
(602) 965-4210.

MICAR will hold a week-long seminar in
computer-assisted reporting May 23-28. This is
the famous MICAR "boot camp" in which
students learn the process of downloading and
analyzing data stored on nine-track magnetic
tape through hands-on training.

Seminar topics include: the facts behind
magnetic tape storage, relational database
theory, Structured Query Language, testing for
data validity and the law regarding electronic
records.

Students return to their newsrooms ready to
apply what they've learned and begin producing
stories.

Extensive computer knowledge isn't required.
The first day of class includes computer basics
and getting around in DOS. But because of the
grueling pace, only the highly motivated are
encouraged to attend.

Class size is limited to 12 to ensure individual-
ized attention. Cost varies according to circula-
tion size or market share.

For more information, contact MICAR, 120
Neff Hall, Columbia, Mo., 65211, (314) 882-0684.
