ELECTIONS
Post-vote
politics,
payoffs
By Andrea Lorenz,
IRE and NICAR
November has come and gone.
Journalists, readers and view-
ers don't want to hear or see the
words "red" and "blue" in the
same sentence as the word
"state." The 2004 presidential
election is long over.
But story ideas abound for en-
terprising journalists who want
to use computer-assisted re-
porting to find out what hap-
pened in the elections and ex-
plore possible connections be-
tween campaign contributions
and political favors.
Power and influence
"Who paid for this election, and
what do they want?" asked Ron
Campbell, a staff writer at The
Orange County Register. Jour-
nalists can answer these ques-
tions with the help of campaign
finance data available on the
Web or from the IRE and
NICAR Database Library. Cam-
paign contributions can explain
why some bills pass Congress
and other stall in committee.

SPOTLIGHT: PROBING THE POLICE
Mapping, stats show
scope of racial bias
By Andy Lehren, Dateline NBC
For a few days in April 2001, it was hard
to miss news accounts about riots in Cin-
cinnati.
Daily stories outlined how police officers
chased an unarmed 19-year-old black
man named Timothy Thomas. It was past
midnight in the Over-The-Rhine neigh-
borhood.
A dispatcher called in officers to help
pursue Thomas. The voice over the po-
lice radio offered a few details: a brief
description of Thomas, and that he had
14 outstanding warrants. An officer re-
sponding to the call spotted Thomas. He
got out of his car and drew his gun, fired
and killed Thomas.
Cincinnati rioters protested the police
shooting, capturing headlines across the

TAX BREAKS
Tallying lost money
through farm loophole
By Paula Lavigne, The Dallas Morning News
Right across the street from our office
building is a field. Every once in a while
we'll notice farm equipment rolling onto
the property, tending to the growing
rows of various crops.
It's prime real estate, almost 110 acres
near the intersection of two major high-
ways. The owners are members of one
of Dallas' most notable old money fami-
lies who, among other pursuits, are
land developers.
They are not farmers. Yet, by leasing
their land to a farmer who reaps a
nominal harvest, they get an agricul-
ture tax break that saves them about
$545,000 each year in taxes. Their sav-
ings is lost money for cities, schools
and county governments.
Last year, two Morning News county
reporters (Ed Housewright and Kevin
Krause) and I decided to investigate

Felon hunters
Matching government databases
can produce high-impact report-
ing. Investigative reporter Steve
Chamraz of KCTV-Kansas City
recently reported on Missouri fel-
ons with hunting licenses who
were discovered with database
matching, and state lawmakers
took note.
KCTV asked the IRE and NICAR
Database Library to compare
state hunting licenses and felon
data tables. Database Library
analysts obtained the data from
the state corrections and conser-
vation departments, cleaned the
data and formatted the tables to
make database matching pos-
sible. Then the analysts matched
the two tables.
The results: nearly 1,000 felons
-13 of them convicted killers
in Missouri had hunting licenses.
It is against federal law for felons
to own or even hold a gun. How-
ever, it is not against Missouri
state law to sell firearm-hunting
permits to convicted felons.
As a result of the report, some
state legislators are considering
changing the state law. See the
report at www.kctv5.com/Global/

Politics and elections:
An evolving story
By David Herzog, NICAR and Missouri School of Journalism
Covering elections and politics is an
ongoing enterprise. The November
presidential election is over and the
crush of resulting stories has lightened.
Still, it's good to remember that some
of the best stories coming out of the
elections are the ones developing now,
the ones you can do any time of the
year to examine subjects that are key
to understanding our democracy: po-
litical power and voter registration, to
name just two.
In the most recent election season,
journalists from coast to coast fired up
their databases and discovered inter-
esting stories about voters registered
in more than one locale, political non-
profit contributions and problems with
felon-voter purge lists - all great sto-
ries. From the stories reported so far,
it's clear that even more are waiting to
be uncovered.

TRAINING
IRE and NICAR have several train-
ing opportunities for journalists
seeking hands-on instruction in
using computer-assisted reporting.
There are three weeklong Boot
Camps in Columbia, Mo., for journal-
ists who want to learn how to acquire
electronic information, use spread-
sheets and databases to analyze the
information, and to translate that in-
formation into high-impact stories.
IRE and NICAR provide follow-up
help after participants return to their
news organizations. The Boot
Camps for this year are March 20-
25, May 15-20 and Aug. 7-12.

FIRST VENTURE
Data helps uncover
Ohio's dangerous dams
By Ron Regan, WEWS-Cleveland
Our November news report that 450 of
Ohio's 1,700 dams are considered un-
safe provoked a nearly incredulous re-
sponse from the state's dam safety
chief: "How did you run across that?"
Admittedly, that was pretty obscure in-
formation. Considered more closely, it's
information that could ultimately save
lives and there was only one way for
me to get it by using a database
manager to analyze dam inspections
data. Before last August, when I at-
tended an IRE and NICAR Boot Camp,
I was clueless about how to do that.
For years, computer-assisted reporting
remained a mystery. Yet, without those
skills, my ability to closely examine the
condition of Ohio's dams would have
been extremely lacking.
And best of all - this was a report that
had started in the Boot Camp lab last
summer. In other words, I left a week
of training with a story in my pocket.
Not bad. (See the March 1996 Uplink
for guidelines in evaluating dams).
Here's how it went from the classroom
to viewers' living rooms: It started with a
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers database
called the National Inventory of Dams. I
first laid eyes on the database during the
NICAR training and quickly realized I
could turn this from a classroom exer-
cise into a more comprehensive report.
So, before leaving the Boot Camp, I pur-
chased the data from the IRE and NICAR
Database Library (for more information
see www.nicar.org/data/dams) and with
some assistance from Jeff Porter, the
director of the Database Library, was able
to whittle down the data for the United
States in the Microsoft Access database
manager to just Ohio dams.
This is so elementary that CAR veter-
ans will probably snicker at the thought
of someone who was so enthralled with
entry-level database work. But, if you're
reading this, there's a good chance that
it is as much of a mystery to you as it
was to me.
I wanted to know how many of these
dams were near cities, who owns them
and when they were last inspected. Ac-
cess, the database manager we used
in the Boot Camp, helped answer these
questions.
Think of Access as a big data con-
tainer, or a filing cabinet. You can use
it to store and view data tables, and to
write queries that filter your data. I was
able to use Structured Query Lan-
guage (SQL) to write queries that
showed me the name of each dam, the
year its construction was completed,
the most recent inspection date and the
hazard level, which indicated how close
the dam is to populated areas. In my
queries, I asked for dams with a high
hazard level.
With a few keystrokes - and I mean
very few - I discovered 1,727 dams in
Ohio with 462 rated high hazard. Not
only that, many of the dams appeared
to have gone years without inspection.
And, most disturbing, many of them
were more than 50 years old.
Now, here's the really big lesson in
learning CAR: You can run queries in
seconds, but that does not replace old-
fashioned fact-checking and digging. I
obtained paper records of the most
recent inspections, using open-records
requests. Without checking the paper
records, I would have made serious
errors.
I also learned that visiting the dams and
walking around them pays off. I discov-
ered a charming 85-year-old who lived

MAPPING
IT OUT
The latest uses of mapping
in news reporting.
Blocking out
unsolved
murders
By Doug Smith,
Los Angeles Times
Sometimes a database story starts
with an idea. Other times it arises
from the data itself. In this case, it
was both.
Every once in a while, a reporter
walks up to my desk with a diskette
or a CD-ROM in hand and asks for-
lornly, "Can you open this?"
I always try to stop what I'm doing
and take a look at their data, know-
ing that the question really means,
"Can you find out if there is anything
worthwhile on this disk and tell me
what it is?"
Most of the time I give a few tips on
using Microsoft Excel, and the re-
porter goes away with one or two
nuggets to put into a story that was
largely reported by traditional means.
But the result was quite different
when reporter Jill Leovy, who was
covering homicide, showed up at my
desk with a CD. Leovy had a spe-
cific question. She wanted to know
whether the data on the CD would
help resolve her suspicion that the
Los Angeles Police Department was
deploying too few detectives in
South Los Angeles where homi-
cides were most prevalent.
Besides hanging out with detectives
and spending nights and weekends
with the families of homicide victims,
Leovy also had built a back-channel
connection in the LAPD's Information
Technology Division. Through it she
had acquired a database of every
homicide investigated by the LAPD
since 1988. Even though this was
public information, my experience
with the LAPD was enough to tell me
this was a real find. If I had asked for
it six months ago, I'd still be waiting
for an interview to talk about what for-
mat it should come in.
I quickly looked through the table
and had to inform Leovy that it
wouldn't answer her question. It
would be easy to break down homi-
cides geographically, but there was
no information on the detectives'
identities. We couldn't calculate
caseloads.
Leovy looked disappointed and went
away. Then I started getting handwrit-
ten notes on my desk. Each one had
the name of a police division, a list of
years and a number for each year.
She was going to each of the 18 po-
lice divisions to look through old de-
tective rosters. I started keypunching.
When she was done, I did a simple
calculation that showed the
caseload for every division for ev-
ery year. It was obvious that detec-
tives working South Los Angeles
had consistently been burdened
with more cases than those in the
Westside or Valley. This provided the
statistical support for Leovy's ac-
count of hardworking detectives in-
undated with cases they seldom
could solve.
All the while, I was doing my own
analysis of the data. The division
breakdown showed that homicides
were far more frequent in South Los
Angeles, but that wasn't news. In
1995, Dick O'Reilly, the then- Times
director of computer-assisted re-
porting, did an exhaustive analysis
of homicide in Los Angeles County.
He established the prevalence of
homicides in South Los Angeles
and the fact that only about half of
homicides are solved. Leovy and I
had data covering twice the period
in O'Reilly's study, but we had to ask
ourselves what was new.
Our concept began to focus on
Leovy's experience that the percep-
tion and fear of violence are always
present in some neighborhoods. I
did a little math in my head and re-
alized that with a 50 percent clear-
ance rate, there would be a lot of
killers who were never brought to
justice roaming the streets of South
Los Angeles. We shifted our focus
to unsolved homicides, and I turned
to mapping to find patterns.
Using ESRI ArcView 8.2, I
geocoded the homicides and made
a subset of the unsolved ones.
Geocoding is one of the most use-
ful tools it turns street addresses
in data tables into point maps. I use
it to analyze geographic data for
patterns, to present story ideas to
editors and to prepare graphics for
publication. It doesn't take long to
do a first pass that will match 80
percent or more of the addresses
in a data table. That's enough to
show me whether there is anything
worth pursuing.
The first pass yielded startling re-
sults. By laying the dots over a street
map, I saw that a large area had one
or more unsolved homicides on al-
most every block.
My next step was to produce theme
maps to show unsolved homicides as
a ratio of population and area of Cen-
sus tracts. To do this, I had to use
ArcView's spatial join function, so I
could assign data from one layer to
another. These made strong presen-
tation tools when Leovy and I pitched
the project to our senior editors. We

got the go-ahead to build a graphic
and to pursue the story.
Now that I was working toward pub-
lication, it was important to get the
highest match rate possible in the
geocoding. That meant spending a
couple of days using ArcView's in-
teractive geocoding feature to
manually match about 2,000 un-
matched addresses. In the end, I got
about 95 percent of the total.
I also reconsidered the measure-
ments for our story. Not only was I
comparing a 12-year accumulation
of unsolved killings against the cur-
rent population, I realized there was
little visual or visceral impact in
showing homicides as a rate per
10,000 people or per square mile.
It finally hit me that the ideal base was
the city block. By shading individual
blocks with the number of unsolved
homicides that occurred on them, I
produced the dramatic pattern that
was ultimately published. It was easy
to see that a person walking in many
parts of South Los Angeles couldn't
avoid the scenes of one unsolved ho-
micide after another. No rate was nec-
essary because everyone knows
what a block is.
So I switched to using a Census
block map and did a spatial join with
the homicide points. This added a
new field to the block map table with
the number of homicides within
each block, which I used to create
a theme map.
To emphasize the difference be-
tween the Valley and South Los An-
geles, I gave graphics artist
Rebecca Perry blowups of two parts
of the city with the individual homi-
cides showing. One had almost no
dots while the other had a dense
pattern.
I also added an elementary school
shapefile and made a table show-
ing the number of unsolved homi-
cides within a quarter mile of each
elementary school in the blowups.
The scale was too large to accom-
modate a complete street grid,
which would have delineated the
individual blocks. The pattern
worked well enough without them
except for a few very large blocks in
the mountains that run around and
through Los Angeles. Some of these
are so large they made a single
homicide look like a crime wave. We
made an executive decision to leave
out blocks that are greater than a
quarter square mile. We noted this
omission in the graphic text.
Once the graphic was done, I went
to work on the Web presentation. I
wanted readers to be able to see
the unsolved homicides in their own
neighborhoods. After some experi-
mentation, I broke Los Angeles into
map areas to get a small enough
scale to show individual dots. Over
a couple of days, I made 25 Adobe
Acrobat Portable Document Files
with the street grid showing lightly
in the background. The Web staff
turned this into an interactive dis-
play that allowed users to click on a
master grid of the city and open one
of the 25 detailed maps.
There's no way to gauge the impact
of these two stories. They generated
significant reader response but did not
prompt any overt policy change by the
LAPD. In fact, the new police chief
William Bratton quickly observed on
his own that violent crime in South
Los Angeles was not getting the at-
tention it deserved. Even before our
stories were published, he started
tinkering with deployments to beef up
the detective strength in overworked

SPOTLIGHT: PROBING THE POLICE
Analysis finds
'law in disorder'
By Heather Ratcliffe and Trisha Howard, St. Louis Post-Dispatch
As the police department in the small
Missouri town of Kinloch crumbled
from incompetence, cops began
whispering to reporters.
They said many of the other 123 po-
lice agencies that patrol the St. Louis
area shared the same problems. Re-
sources were spread too thin, caus-
ing dangerously inconsistent law en-
forcement.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch began
an investigation to discover why.
What we found was far more signifi-
cant than inconsistency.
In flagrant violation of police licens-
ing laws, untrained auxiliary officers
were patrolling alone and answering
calls for help. There were troubled
officers shuffling amoung poor de-
partments willing to take whomever
they can get.
There were broken-down patrol cars
and one department with no two-way
radios. There were procedures so
loose that one small-town cop shot a
motorist by mistake and then fired
again when the man fled for his life.
There were budgets so tight that po-
lice refrained from calling in license
checks to a dispatching service.
There were departments whose of-
ficers' conduct at crime scenes would
shock anyone who has watched even
a single episode of CSI.
During the yearlong investigation we
amassed an enormous amount of
data through public information re-
quests. Crime rates, budgets, officer
salaries and other statistics were
compiled into spreadsheets and com-
pared in graphics topped by a re-
gional map that gave a clear overview
of the problem.

Joined by photographers Andrew
Cutraro and David Carson, we spent
weeks on patrol with more than two
dozen police departments, riding along
day and night to document the quality
of law enforcement at street level.
The end result was a series of articles
titled "The Law in Disorder," available
on the Web at www.stltoday.com/police.
Casting the net
Research began in October 2002 when
we requested records from 62 police
departments in St. Louis County. Sev-
eral months later the scope of the story
expanded to include the six-county
area around St. Louis.
In the spring of 2003, we mailed open
records requests to more than 140
police departments seeking such in-
formation as their annual budgets,
staff lists, salaries paid to chiefs and
starting officers, and policies for us-
ing deadly force and pursuing fleeing
suspects.
Police departments with volunteer of-
ficers were asked for additional infor-
mation. We asked to review three
months of duty logs, arrest reports
and traffic tickets. We were looking for
evidence of uncertified officers en-
forcing laws and therefore violating
state regulations.
Some police departments responded
in a few days. Others took as long as
three months. At least three depart-
ments never complied with the FOIA
requests after repeated telephone
calls and faxes.
Most of the departments provided the
information free of charge. Some
mailed it to the newspaper, and oth-
ers required reporters to pick it up in
person and show identification. Some
departments charged up to $1 a page
in research and copying fees.
None of the departments provided
these documents electronically.
One acting police chief told a reporter
that he had never heard of his state's
open records law. When pressed, he
said his staff didn't have time to put
together the requested statistics.
He changed his tune when we called
the city attorney.
For those departments that never re-
sponded, we enlisted the help of Post-
Dispatch reporters who cover those
cities to get the information. They suc-
ceeded, demonstrating the value of
teamwork in the newsroom.
Data challenges
We discovered inconsistencies in
record keeping in the two states in the
St. Louis area - Missouri and Illinois.
While Missouri officials would not re-
lease details of an officer's work his-
tory, Illinois could not provide a com-
plete list of every certified police of-
ficer in the state.
State and federal court records
proved to be extremely valuable in our
research. We relied mostly on civil
lawsuits to document cases of officer
misconduct because police depart-
ments would not release such infor-
mation.
We gathered Uniform Crime Report
statistics electronically from the Mis-
souri Department of Public Safety and
the FBI. Reporters downloaded the Il-
linois crime data from the state's Web
site.
We quickly learned the flaws of rely-
ing too much on self-reported crime
statistics. We found that police depart-
ments counted their crimes differently
and some failed to submit their num-
bers each year.
We decided to compare only violent
crimes to get a fairer representation
about the dangers in each community.
January • February 2005
==End of OCR for page 8==
==Start of OCR for page 9==
We also averaged the crime rate over
three years to get a more accurate
account.
We used spreadsheets in Microsoft
Excel to track the vast amount of in-
formation we gathered.
We entered the 5,900 officers into a
spreadsheet so we could search the
names, track their certification status
and make notes on each officer whom
we found to be accused of miscon-
duct.
Reporters used the budgets to cal-
culate statistics such as cost per
capita, cost per call and cost per of-
ficer.
Spreadsheets also helped reporters or-
ganize the status of the department's
response to record requests.
The information was presented in a
series of graphics that included a
color-coded map of the per-capita
costs. Those, paired with photos of
shoddy equipment and poor tactics,
provided a compelling presentation.
Reaction from the public was imme-
diate. We received hundreds of phone
calls, e-mails and letters expressing
outrage about the quality of policing
in St. Louis.
The St. Louis County Prosecuting At-
torney launched an investigation into
the misuse of volunteer officers. The
Missouri State Auditor began a probe
into the state program that investi-
gates police misconduct.
Months after the series was pub-
lished, the newspaper still receives
requests from residents and public
officials wanting more information.
Many have requested additional cop-
ies of the stories and graphics to use
in their own work.

SPOTLIGHT: PROBING THE POLICE
Data shows cops
ignore hot-pursuit rules
By lan Demsky and Christian Bottorff, The (Nashville) Tennessean
Just because a police department says
it followed all the rules doesn't make it
true.
After a presumed hand-to-hand drug
transaction in January, Nashville po-
lice chased a fleeing suspect through
residential neighborhoods into down-
town.
At a busy intersection near a high
school that was about to dismiss stu-
dents, the suspect ran a red light and
crashed into a car. His car flipped over,
and he was killed. The motorist who
was hit escaped with minor injuries.
After that chase, we wanted to learn
the rules the police have for chases
and determine how often they break
the rules.
The policy was very clear: Officers may
chase only if allowing a suspect to flee
"would present an imminent danger to
human life or cause serious injury." The
guidelines say a suspect's erratic driv-
ing, speed and attempts to evade are
to be "minor considerations" in decid-
ing whether to continue the chase. In
other words, just because a suspect
flees, the police do not have license to
chase him.
Considering the case in which the sus-
pect crashed downtown, it did not
seem there was an imminent danger
to life or potential to cause serious in-
jury from the drug transaction.
The department insisted the chase
was within policy, but we decided to
examine all pursuits from 2003.
We found that 67 percent of the pur-
suits appeared to have violated the
written policy.
Additionally, we found that pursuits of
suspects wanted for minor traffic viola-
tions led to the most accidents and in-
juries and were more likely to exceed
the speed limit by 30 mph than during
other chases.
Building a database
We started with the original paper
records kept by the police department.
First, we photocopied all 229 of the
pursuit report forms and attached nar-
ratives generated after each pursuit.
The officer is required to fill out the form
after each pursuit as a liability precau-
tion to ensure the pursuit met guide-
lines. The reports are then reviewed by
several supervisors.
We started with the
original paper
records kept by the
police department
We created a Microsoft Access data-
base with the fields we wanted to track
and entered the data from the paper
records. We created fields to track the
distance of the chase, the reason it
started and the way it ended. Check-
boxes indicated whether police, sus-
pects or bystanders were injured or had
their cars or property damaged. We
also had fields for the speed of the pur-
suit, traffic conditions and whether the
pursuit went through a residential or
school zone.
It took a few long nights, but as it turned
out, that was the best method we could
have chosen.
If we had requested an electronic da-
tabase from the department, we
wouldn't have found the story. The da-
tabase they kept of chases is entered
from the same paper records we used,
but it didn't match the paper records.
The department's database showed far
fewer fast chases and far more slow
chases than the records indicated.
They couldn't account for this discrep-
ancy. The database lacked the officers'
narratives, which we used to correct
inconsistencies with the paper forms.
Also, the department failed to fill out
the reports consistently. For example,
if officers attempted to stop a person
for weaving while driving, one form
might be marked "traffic," one "misde-
meanor" for reckless driving and one
"DUI." Or it might have several reasons
marked.
We knew that to determine which pur-
suits appeared to violate the policy,
we'd have to come up with our own
system to keep track of how the pur-
suits started. We also wanted to be able
to demonstrate that we had given the
department the benefit of the doubt
whenever we could. For example, if a
person was chased for outstanding
warrants for which the nature wasn't
listed, we assumed the warrants were
for violent offenses and categorized it
under our category of major life-threat-
ening crimes.
Using information from the narratives
and long discussions, we categorized
the chases based upon what the sus-
pect was wanted for when the chase
began. So if the police discovered that
the car had been stolen during a chase
for a traffic violation, we counted the
chases under "traffic."
Our categories were:
Minor traffic violation - headlight out,
speeding, improper tags, running a
stop sign, etc.
Major traffic violation-reckless driving,
DUI or any indication by the officer that
10

he or she felt a need to get the sus-
pect off the street to protect the public.
Minor, non-life threatening crime - tres-
passing, breaking into cars, soliciting
a prostitute and drug transactions.
Major, life-threatening crimes
Stolen vehicles: We made this a sepa-
rate category because, although on the
surface it was a property crime, it
seemed to fall in a gray area and was
often linked with other crimes.
In many cases, the form itself did not
match the narratives or was missing
information, and in those cases we re-
lied on the narratives to fill in the gaps.
The forms had a checkbox to indicate
whether the pursuit had complied with
policy. Only seven times did that box
say a pursuit had failed to meet the
department's policy. One supervisor
wrote that he knew the chase didn't
comply, but because the suspect was
later found to have committed other
crimes, he decided it was justified.
The pursuit reporting forms lacked criti-
cal detail regarding the duration, dis-
tance and top speed of the pursuit. In-
stead, the form had checkboxes for
ranges. For example, for the duration,
the officers had the choice of checking
boxes for less than one minute, one to
five minutes, six to 10 minutes, and so
on. So we selected text formats for
these fields, and as a result, we could
not run the calculations we would have
liked.
Also, the way the department recorded
how a chase ended was even more
confusing. We could not easily tell
whether any property was damaged or
anyone was hurt.
In several cases, the records indicated
there were injuries in the pursuit, but
according to the narratives, these hap-
pened during scuffles between police
and suspects afterward. We did not in-
clude these injuries in our calculations.

nation. Fellow Dateline NBC producer
Jason Samuels and I were asked to look
into the circumstances surrounding these
events. After collecting traffic ticketing
data and going through court records, I
came back to the dispatcher's brief call
on the radio: 14 outstanding warrants.
How does a 19-year-old rack up so many
warrants?
That question led us on a lengthy in-
vestigation that culminated with an
hour-long report called "A Pattern of
Suspicion." With correspondent John
Larson, we examined disparities in how
police across the United States deal
with blacks and whites.
Despite its national scope, the story fo-
cused on something simple: a traffic ticket.
That's because Thomas' 14 outstanding
warrants all stemmed from traffic tickets.
Almost all were for the tickets themselves,
and the last two were for fleeing from of-
ficers for not paying the traffic tickets.
There was also something intriguing
about the kinds of traffic tickets that
Thomas got. They were not for the usual
things, like speeding or running a stop
sign. Almost every citation was for an
offense that is difficult or almost impos-
sible for an officer to know about with-
out first stopping someone. The list in-
cludes driving with a passenger not
wearing a seatbelt and driving without
a license. Only one ticket was for a
moving violation.
Police, prosecutors and criminologists
have another way of looking at these tick-
ets. Some, like speeding far above the
speed limit or running a stop sign, are
also known as low-discretion tickets.
These are moving violations, and the of-
fense is obvious even at a distance. Po-
lice don't have to make too many deci-
sions before chasing those drivers.
Then there high-discretion stops for driv-
ing without a seatbelt or having windows
tinted too dark. Notwithstanding special
crackdowns, these non-moving violations
are harder to detect, and are often ig-
nored by officers.
These are usually ignored unless an
officer is looking for something else. In
the war on drugs, police and others told
us it's perfectly legal for an officer to pull
over drivers for these high-discretion vio-
lations in the hope of catching them at
something worse.
Advocates charge this is essentially ra-
cial profiling, violating the equal pro-
tection clause of the 14th Amendment
and also inflaming already strained re-
lations between police and minority
communities.
With Cincinnati's ticketing database, we
were able to see Thomas was not alone
in getting high-discretion non-moving
violations. We obtained the data, with
more than 300,000 entries, through a
state open records request. It included
fields such as the time, street, violation,
the driver's name and demographic in-
formation like race.
By calculating odds ratios, we could see
that blacks were at least three times as
likely as whites to get cited for driving
without a seatbelt or not having a driver's
license.
This kind of ratio is known as an internal
benchmark. It relies on information just
within the ticketing database. You com-
pare the rate for which blacks versus
whites get a high-discretion ticket, like
driving without a seatbelt, and divide that
by the rate for which blacks versus
whites get low-discretion tickets like
speeding. For those interested in learn-
ing more about odds ratios, Sage pub-
lishes several handy books, and Phil
Meyer includes a valuable critique in his
latest edition of "Precision Journalism."
One advantage of internal benchmarks
is that it is an accepted standard in crimi-
nal justice circles, and it does not involve
population estimation. It is as precise as
possible.
Comparing ticketing versus overall popu-
lation is known as an external bench-
mark, and among police, its soundness

is more debatable.
We looked at the data other ways. By
mapping violations in ArcView,
geocoding the locations where tickets
were issued, we could see the dispari-
ties were not particular to Over-The-
Rhine. In predominately white, low-crime
neighborhoods, blacks were still ticketed
far more often for non-moving violations
versus moving violations.
We collected various documents and
reports that were useful for starting our
data shopping list. A General Account-
ing Office (now known as the Govern-
ment Accountability Office) report,
among others, outlined which cities with
at least 100,000 people across the na-
tion are collecting ticketing and stop data.
We sought data from as many city po-
lice departments as possible from coast
to coast. This included police depart-
ments that had never had anyone re-
quest the information-that includes jour-
nalists as well as advocates and aca-
demic researchers.
The problems we encountered are un-
fortunately typical: places like San Diego
took months and months in replying;
Denver rejected our initial request but
later turned over the data, and St. Louis
charged by far the most. In the end, we
had more than 4 million traffic tickets and
stops in more than a dozen cities.
One hurdle we faced was that almost no
city kept the data exactly like another. In
some places, it was impossible to tease
out moving versus non-moving viola-
tions; those cities were excluded from our
analysis. Other police departments re-

gerous dam in Ohio. In addition, I spent

plaining what I was doing. I relied on
them for assistance.
corded stops, and noted the general cat-
egory of the violation, rather than the
precise violation code, that led to the stop.
In those cases, we could include the data
because the categorizations offered at
least a window into that department. As
can be expected, this kind of categori-
zation was limiting because it prevented
us from examining variations within a
grouping - when a police department
was pulling over blacks at a higher rate
for, say, equipment violations, was the
rate even more disproportionate for
seatbelt offenses?
In any city that included geographic in-
formation we mapped out where the vio-
lations occurred. We cross-checked both
high-crime and low-crime neighbor-
hoods. In the end, we mapped more than
1 million addresses in six cities, a pro-
cess that accelerated with programming
that improved standardization.
We performed a logistic regression in
SPSS to examine the effects of other
demographic data on the disparities in-
volving non-moving violations. Logistic
regression tests the probability of an
event, when there are only two possible
outcomes. The results are often reported
as odds or odds ratios. This underscored
how race was a key factor by allowing
us to see essentially how the odds of
someone being black is cited for these
violations, versus the impact of a
person's sex or age.
We constantly re-checked the data and
talked to criminal justice experts. We
gave each police department more
than two months to respond to a writ-
ten summary of our findings. We
wanted to ensure that our work was

accurate, and that every police agency
had an opportunity to talk with us about
what was in the numbers.
The work we did along the way proved
extremely useful in these discussions.
When one department cited a Bureau of
Justice Statistics survey, we could point
out that the questionnaire categorized
stops in a way that made it impossible to
detect moving versus non-moving viola-
tions. When another department cited a
NHTSA study that blacks did not wear
seatbelts about a quarter of the time, we
noted that the rate was virtually the same
for whites.
Only one police department offered a
geographical argument: Richmond said
the ticketing disparity was a result of heavy
policing in high-crime neighborhoods,
which are often black. When we pointed
out that the disparity passed through to
low-crime, predominately white sections,
it responded with "No comment."
For other journalists doing this kind of
story, it's important to get the data, talk
with sources and get familiar with the sub-
ject of ticketing disparities.

Setting up, stocking
your data warehouse
By Aron Pilhofer, The Center for Public Integrity
If you followed the instructions in the
November-December 2004 Uplink, a
MySQL server should be running on
your system or network, though you
would hardly know it. The only evidence
you'll see is an entry for mysqld or
mysqld-nt in the Windows Task Man-
ager processes tab.
So how do you run MySQL and work
with data?
MySQL is different from a standalone
database manager like Microsoft Ac-
cess. The programs (or clients) that you
use to connect to the database engine
(or server) are separate.
Technically speaking, any software inter-
face used to connect to a database is a
client-that includes Web pages or even
the DOS command line. In order to set
up our newsroom database system, we
want something a little more specialized:
a client to help manage our server, data
and system users.
Some database servers come pack-
aged with an official client (Enterprise

Due to the explosion of interest in
MySQL, there are plenty of excellent

Many of the best are free, open source

its $100 price for its unparalleled speed,

become a logistical nightmare. More
importantly, when anyone can open,
change, delete, update and edit data,
it becomes impossible to ensure the
integrity of the data.
MySQL, like all database servers, al-
lows you to control who has access to
which databases, and what they can
do with the data. You can give certain
users access to only certain databases,
specific tables within those databases,
or even particular fields.
You can use MySQL Administrator to
easily create, manage and administer
user accounts by pointing and clicking.

form these functions with the MySQL
command line (see http://dev.mysql
.com/doc/mysql/en/User_Account
_Management.html). You can create a
user-permissions scheme to reflect the
expertise groupings among your news-
room staff and assigned shared users
names to these groups.
Connecting users
Once you have your user scheme in
place, you can connect users with a
client program designed for end users.
There are a number of excellent client
programs available; Query Browser
(above) is good for making a more ro-
bust connection to the database,
though the program is still in early de-
velopment. In addition, users must run
queries using Structure Query Lan-
guage. (For other options, read "Put-
ting a useful face on MySQL" in the
May-June 2003 Uplink).
To connect users using one of the
many MySQL-specific clients, follow
the same procedure you did with Ad-
ministrator. Enter the host name of the
server (usually "localhost," or an IP ad-
dress), as well as the user name and
password - that's it.
But the easiest client for users initially
is one you probably already have on
your newsroom computers: Access. Af-
ter going through a simple setup, us-
ers can link to data tables stored in
MySQL and then write and save que-
ries on those tables
just like any other Ac-
cess table. The only
thing users cannot do
from Access and
this is a problem with
Open Database Con-
nectivity (ODBC), not
MySQL - is create or
alter a table in any
way. That is an opera-
tion that must be done
through Query
Browser or another
MySQL-specific client.
To use Access as a
front end, first you will
need to make sure you have the proper
drivers installed for each user who
wants to connect to MySQL using Ac-
cess. Here's how:
• Open Windows Control Panel and go
to Administrative tools\Data sources.
• Click on the drivers tab and look for
MySQL ODBC driver. If it is there, skip
the next two steps.
• If the driver is not there, download it
from: www.mysql.com/products/con-
nector/odbc.
• Install the driver on all PCs that will
use Access to query data stored in
MySQL.
Then you will need to configure the
ODBC driver:
• Open Windows Control Panel and go
to Administrative tools\Data sources.
• Double-click on the Data sources icon
and then select either the user (data
source name) or system DSN tab (ei-
ther will work, though you may not be
able to save system DSN connections,
depending on Windows security set-
tings.
• Click Add and then find the MySQL
driver, and double click on it.
• In the dialog box that opens, give your
connection a name that your users will
Uplink
be able to understand. Enter the IP ad-
dress of the server, or "localhost" if
MySQL is running on the local ma-
chine. Enter the name of the MySQL
database that you want to connect to.
By default, MySQL installs two data-
bases: MySQL and Test. MySQL is the
database that contains all the user,
password and login information
never, ever, ever give anyone access
to this database. Choose Test.
• Enter the user name and password
you would like this user to log in under
(one of the accounts we created ear-
lier) and click the test data source but-
ton to ensure the connection works. If
it doesn't, you might have to go back
to Administrator and grant that user ac-
count specific privileges to that data-
base, done under the "Schema Privi-
leges" tab in the user accounts section.
Once you've successfully connected,
your users can begin using tables
within the database.
Now the user can use Access' File\Get
external data menu item to link to or
import the MySQL tables. For example,
to import:
• Select Import from the menu.
• Select ODBC databases in the Files
of type list that appears in the dialog
box that opens.
• Navigate to the DSN list and select
the desired data source name
Data in
Now that we've connected to the data-
base, we can put data in it.
There are a number of ways to get data
into a MySQL database. The easiest
is to export tables from Access, for data
tables with 500,000 or fewer records:
• Right click on the table in Access and
select Export.
• Choose ODBC as the file export type
• Click OK in the next dialog box
• Select the DSN into which you wish
to import
Many of the clients available for down-
load or purchase have data import fil-

Tech tip...
Learning to play the Access numbers game
By MaryJo Sylwester, USA Today
You've created a table in Microsoft
Access, and you set the data type
as number. But every time you type
"1.6," it puts "2" in the field. And ev-
ery time you type "10.3," it puts "10."
So you look at the field properties
box in the design view of the table
and it says that the decimal place is
set to auto. So, doesn't that mean it
will automatically accommodate
however many decimal places you
need?
Unfortunately, no.
Access doesn't play that nice. So
here's a primer you can clip out and
hang up next to your computer for
the next time you're pulling your hair
out over number values in Access.
When you create a field in an Ac-
cess table - particularly for nu-
meric values there are at least
two things you need to set.
• Data Type: Text, numeric, date/
time, memo, etc.
• Field Properties: More nitty-gritty
stuff, such as how big the number
can be and number of decimal
places.

Description
You set the data type first. Notice
that the field properties section (the
gray area below the list of fields) will
slightly change depending on what
you picked. Figure 1 shows what it
looks like for Number.
Pulling down on the "Field Size"
drop down list will reveal a list of
options. (See figure 2.)
• Byte
• Integer
• Long Integer (default)
• Single
• Double
• Replication ID
• Decimal
So which to choose? Read on for
various scenarios and guidance.
Scenario One
You need a field to hold whole num-
bers (no decimals) that will be used
for calculations.
Things to consider: How big will the
numbers get? Does the size of the
database matter?
Options:
• Byte: Stores positive integers
(whole numbers) between 1 and
Field Properties
A field name can be up to 64 characters
long, including spaces. Press F1 for help
on field names.
255. Examples: ranking on a limited
scale (such as 1 to 10); day of the
week (such as 1 for Sunday); day
of the month.
• Integer: Stores whole numbers
between -32,768 and 32,768. Ex-
amples: four-digit years; some
sports stats, such as number of
touchdowns.
• Long integer: Stores even larger
integers, between roughly -2 billion
and 2 billion. Use when the num-
bers would be too large to fit into
any of the categories above.
How to choose: If hard drive space
on your computer is an issue, use
the smallest option that is suitable.
If that is not an issue, go with long
integer to be sure you'll have plenty
of space.
Scenario Two
You have a field with numbers that
need one or more decimal places
for some or all of the records.
Things to consider: How many deci-
mal places do you need?
Options:
• Single: Use for numbers with up to
three decimal places.
• Double: Use for numbers with more
than three decimal places.
• Decimal: Use for really big numbers
with way more decimal places than
we will ever need as journalists.
How to decide: Unless you are a
rocket scientist or you're calculating
pi, you'll be fine with Single. Keep
in mind that Single requires 4 bytes,
while Double uses 8. That means
that any calculations you do on that
field will go twice as fast if you use
Single rather than Double. The
speed difference may be indiscern-

ible to your naked eye, but in this
day and age, every second counts.
Specifying number of decimal
places: Unlike Excel, the number of
decimal places displayed is the
same as the number that is stored.
So reducing the number of decimal
places means your number will for-
ever be rounded - including when
you do calculations. In the field prop-
erties box, the Decimal Places op-
tion will be set to "Auto" when you
choose Single or Double. That will
accommodate however many deci-
mal places your data has when you
import or type in a number. If you
want to limit it to two or three, for
example, change the "Auto" to one
of the numbers in the pull-down list.

A word of warning: If you're import-
ing data that contain decimals, you
must be sure the field it is going into
can accommodate decimals. (If im-
porting a text file, you can set the Data
Type to Single or Double in the Im-
port Wizard). If the data instead goes
into a plain integer field with no deci-
mal places, you'll lose the decimals.
Scenario Three
You have a field of numbers - no
decimal points and you do not
want to do any calculations.
This might be ZIP codes, a unique
identifier, or another code, particu-
larly if it has leading zeros.
Things to consider: If this same field
appears in another table in your
database (especially if it is a unique
identifier), be sure that you use the
same data type in both tables.
Nothing to decide here: Simply set
the Data Type to Text. Then adjust
the "Field size" to accommodate the
largest possible number of digits.
Scenario Four
You have special numeric values:
dollar values or percentages.
Access makes working with dollars
and percentages a bit easier by hav-
ing pre-set Data Types or Formats
that show the symbols as part of the
number. Of course, you can store a
dollar value as a Number (Data
Type) and either Long Integer or
Single (Field size) it just won't
have the $ sign and commas.
Setting as Currency: Under Data
Type choose Currency and in the
field properties box you can set
Decimal Places or leave it at Auto
(which will give you two).
Setting as Percentage: If you have a
field that contains percentages in
decimal format (such as 0.50 for 50
percent), then you can change it so
that it displays as 50.00%. Set the
Data Type as Number and in the field
properties box set the Format to Per-
cent. It doesn't matter what you
choose for field size because it will
automatically set two decimal places.

Tax break
continued from page 1
just how much tax money schools, cit-
ies, and counties lost through these
agricultural exemptions.
We also wanted to know which land-
owners profited the most from the tax
break. Were they really farm families
for whom the exemption was created
almost 30 years ago?
Or were they corporations, developers
and land speculators looking to save
millions in taxes by leasing the land for
farming?
Our goal was straightforward. We
wanted to measure the taxable value
of the agriculturally designated land
and its market value.
Then we had to calculate taxes based
on the agricultural value versus the
market value to find the total revenue
lost to exempt property.

IRE MEMBERS: $15 each • NONMEMBERS: $25 each
from our four main counties: Dallas,
Denton, Collin, and Tarrant. In Texas,
entities called appraisal districts assess
properties for the various taxing entities.
The Tarrant Appraisal District had all of
its data available for free download on
its Web site. The Denton district sent
its data to us on CD. We had previously
paid for Collin County data, but the ap-
praisal district didn't charge us for this
year's update, downloaded via FTP.
Dallas district officials initially said they
were going to charge us for our down-
load, but never did.
The format of each district's data var-
ied. Dallas' was in Microsoft SQL Server
format. Collin's was in dBASE. Denton's
was comma delimited text. Tarrant's ini-
tially came with special translation soft-
ware, but it was too cumbersome so the
technician there ended up sending a
comma delimited file.
The number of records ranged from
about 270,000 for Collin to about
900,000 for Dallas, with a maximum of
30 fields.
The format and content of property
records vary greatly from state to state,
and even within Texas the format was
often different among the neighboring
districts.
For example, the field titled "appraised"
in one database means the taxable
value whereas it means market value
in another.
I talked to every database manager
before coming up with my methodology
to make sure I was using the right cat-
egories. After I finished, I outlined my
step-by-step process and e-mailed it to
them asking them to try to poke holes
in it. They responded that my methods
were sound.
The calculations were simple. Using
Microsoft FoxPro, I created four sepa-
rate smaller tables from the original
large datasets (more than 1 million
records in one case). I chose records
in which the amount in the agricultural
value field was greater than zero.
I created a Microsoft Access database
and imported the smaller files so I and
the other reporters could work on them.
Cutting losses
For each table, I ran a sum query on
the market and agriculture (or taxable)
value fields.
The difference between market value
and agriculture taxable value provided
the value of taxable property exempt
or "lost" to the taxing districts. I put
these LOST numbers in a separate
column. But it's not the amount of lost
tax revenue yet. That takes another
step.
Each property record in an appraisal
district database includes one or sev-
eral fields to indicate that property's
taxing entities. One district had them
all crammed into one field separated
by commas: CAD, CCS, PRK, JSO.
The number of entities varied from one
to five, and they were not always in the
same order.
Another district had fields labeled
COUNTY, CITY, SCHOOL, SPEC1,
SPEC2, SPEC3, SPEC4, SPEC5 and
the appropriate codes were in each
field. One had six columns.
I did a GROUP BY on each entity field
and a SUM on the newly created LOST
field. That gave me the total value lost
by each entity.
I had previously downloaded Excel or
text files from the districts' Web sites
with each taxing jurisdiction's tax rate.
I plugged my LOST totals into those
files. The tax rate is per $100 in tax-
able value, so I divided my LOST to-
tals by $100 and multiplied them by the
tax rate for each entity.
The result: The total amount of tax rev-
enue each taxing entity lost this year
because of the agriculture tax break.
One district in a fast-growing suburb
north of Dallas was losing more than
$20 million in revenue. Speculators and
businesses with valuable land were
paying a pittance in taxes because they
18

==Start of OCR for page 19==
either ran a farming operation on it
themselves or leased it to a farmer to
keep it agriculturally active.
After we saw who the big losers were,
we wanted to find the big winners.
Winning big
I started to calculate this by doing a
GROUP BY on the taxpayer name field
and a SUM on the LOST field. Of
course, companies tend to spell their
names several different ways. If I
grouped by Electronic Data Systems, I
missed all the entries for EDS.
I also grouped by taxpayer ID and by
the taxpayer address field. After tak-
ing three or four swipes at this, I felt
confident that I had grouped as many
of the largest companies and landown-
ers together as possible.
I struggled to definitively say that a cer-
tain proportion of property owners
claiming the exemption were big busi-
nesses or land speculators. But filter-
ing out company names with a Co.,
Corp., Inc., etc., wasn't really scientific,
plus some of those entries were actu-
ally small farm families that had incor-
porated for tax purposes.
So, I dumped my taxpayer file that I
recently sorted into Excel.
My intent was to find an easy way to
prove that most or more than half -
the value of the ag exemption was held
by major corporations or land specu-
lators.
I started by sorting descending by the
companies with the largest amount of
taxable value deducted because of the
exemption. I did a rolling sum of those
values until the total sum equaled more
than half the total sum of the exemption
values. There were few enough rows that
I could go through the landowners one
by one to determine if they were farmers
or businesses/speculators.
Here's how I did that: Say my last col-
umn was J, and J was the difference be-
tween market and taxable value. I cre-
ated another column, Column K, in which
I calculated what percentage of Column
J's total value was represented by cell
J2, the sum of cells J2 and J3, the sum
of cells J2, J3, and J4, etc. I was looking
for the point at which all the property own-
ers who owned 51 percent of the total
value of agriculture land savings were
listed.
Through some calculations, and some
eyeballing, I determined that most of
the value was attributable to large cor-
porations and property development
companies. "Most" was good enough
for my purposes at this point.
We also decided to map the parcels
receiving the tax break using ESRI
ArcView 8.3, and the parcel shapefiles
the districts gave us for free. That be-
came a nice four-county map showing
the outlying suburban land basically
engulfed in low-tax, high-value prop-
erty.
That was the CAR part. The rest in-
volved all three of us interviewing prop-
erty owners, farmers, appraisers, agri-
culture industry trade representatives,

Tips for working with property tax
data from Paula Lavigne, The
Dallas Morning News
1. Get the codebooks for your data
and have the appraisers explain
which codes are still used and what
the fields mean.
2. Find out how the system records
subdivided land. Does the master
parcel's ID number go away, or is it
attached to one of the smaller
parcels? And how does it measure
the change in value when a large
parcel dissolves into several smaller
ones?
3. If you're measuring the change
in value over time, find the best way

business representatives, and school,
city and county officials.
Despite our numbers showing that big
corporations were benefiting from the
tax break in the short term, they argued
they paid back the value through the
rollback. The rollback provision makes
landowners pay five years of back
taxes plus interest when the land's use
changes and it's no longer agricultural.
However, they could keep any benefit
beyond five years.
Farmers and ranchers were the most
vocal proponents of the system. Even
though they're not benefiting directly
from the tax break, they are able to
lease cheap land and keep farming in
an area where vacant farmland is dis-
appearing.

to join data tables containing other
years of data. Watch out for duplicate
or missing records, especially when
dealing with subdivided commercial
or residential lots or with properties
that cross city and county lines.
4. Be wary of owner names; different
spellings or styles are common. If you
want to group or sort by property
owner, see if there's a property owner
ID or a taxpayer billing address.
Sometimes those are more reliable.
5. Be suspicious of numbers that
seem too high or two low, and use
with medians rather than averages.
Errors, exemptions, new construction
and other factors can distort your
numbers. And make sure you know
the difference between how the
appraisers calculate the market value
and the taxable value.

In 2001, after the previous presiden-
tial election, The Wall Street Journal
investigated campaign, inaugural and
recount fund contributions by industry.
A yearlong series of stories by the Jour-
nalshowed the GOP's top 10 contribu-
tors. Journal reporters tracked the
policy interests of the contributors and
found the administration and Congress
supported (or opposed) legislation in
line with the interests of contributors.
Tom Hamburger, who was the Journal's
money and politics reporter at the time,
says once the data analysis by The
Center for Responsive Politics was
complete, Journal staffers on every
Washington beat were involved in the
reporting. Says Hamburger, analyzing
contributions to the administration and
legislators shows the public how the
government works and affects lives.
The problem with donation stories,
Campbell says, comes from the neces-
sity of joining three databases together.
For example, to find out who gave
money to which candidates in Califor-
nia, reporters need Federal Election
Campaign data, 527 contribution data
available on the IRS Web site and data
from the California secretary of state.
Checking changes
Campaign data also can help journal-
ists look at structural changes in poli-
tics and provide context. "Why is [bil-
lionaire George] Soros writing all these
checks?" Derek Willis of The Washing-
ton Postasks. "It has to do with struc-
tural changes."
Changes in tactics, laws and proce-
dures affect donors, parties and com-
mittees. In October, The Washington
Post published an article detailing the
results of the paper's analysis of 527
data maintained by The Center for Pub-
lic Integrity. They found six out of 10
donors to 527 groups are billionaires.
The McCain-Feingold campaign fi-
nance law prohibited soft money con-
tributions to political parties. The Post
used data to show how the 2002 law
affected the process. To make up for
the new constraints, donors gave more
money to state parties.
Some of the structural changes are so
minute, Willis says, that reporters have
to understand campaign finance law as
well as political science professors and
campaign lawyers do. He points to a
radio ad that aired before the election.
The campaign ad criticized a proposal
by Democratic candidate Sen. John
Kerry. At one point, words were added
to include liberals in Congress. Willis
says doing this allowed the campaign
to share a cost of the ad with the party.

Changes that might seem insignificant
to people are deliberate. "It's got to be
the data," Willis says. "You can't see
them in meetings making decisions
about what to do, but you can see
where the money goes."
Structural changes made before the
election might not be apparent until
afterward. Now is a good time to figure
out first what the changes are, and next
how did they affect the election. It's best
to have earlier data, Willis says. Com-

to the last election. If power changed
hands, fundraising might change. Who

failed to check whether newly

of the year, he says.
And of course, any analysis done for
prone to error. The newspaper
reported that voters using touch-
screen voting machines were 50
percent more likely to make an error,
compared to voters who used a
voting machine that used paper
ballots.
The Boston Globe Ideas section
carried an analysis of the national
presidential vote and examined the
regions where President Bush and
challenger Sen. John Kerry drew their
support. The reporting was based on
continuing geographic information
system (GIS) data analysis by
Commonwealth Magazine.
Just before the election, The Miami
Heraldreported that an overwhelmed
clemency system was blocking felons
from having their voting rights
restored. The analysis found that
nearly 40,000 felons released from
custody from 2001 to 2003 were
unable to vote.

2006 and 2008 federal elections. If you

state madness, now is a good time to
get back; the data is waiting.

The data the department later gave us
did.
Two things we found extremely help-
ful: a memo field in which we could note
brief highlights, interesting examples
or questions we had and unique iden-
tification numbers for each chase,
which we also wrote on our copies of
the paper records. Those ID numbers
allowed us to easily move between the
data and the records. (They also
helped us reconstruct our data when
we deleted something from a query
and accidentally killed information in
the underlying table.)
We also kept track of the gender and
race, finding that 63 percent of those
pursued were black, but our editors de-
cided not to a purse a racial angle on
the story because they thought it would
take away the punch from our story
about policy violations.
Later, we used ESRI ArcView 3.2 geo-
graphic information system to map the
starting locations and times of the pur-
suits. We saw that the chases occurred
more often at night in areas with
higher-than- average black popula-
tions. The police explained that this was
because those locations had the high-
est concentration of officers.
About a week before the story ran, we
presented our methods and findings to
the police department. At first, the re-
cently hired chief and support person-
nel came back with their own data that
said far fewer chases violated policy.
But their data turned out to be inaccu-
rate because of department data-en-
try errors. After some discussion, they
agreed that according to the way we
classified our data, it showed that two-
thirds of the pursuits didn't meet the
threshold of imminent danger listed in
the policy.
Our reporting - from photocopying the
records with a portable copier to writ-
ing the story - took about two weeks.
After the story ran, the new police chief
announced changes to the pursuit
policy. He said he had been looking at
it before our analysis.
The new policy didn't change the justi-
fication for chases, but it gives super-
visors the responsibility to authorize
each pursuit and grant continuing per-
mission as the conditions of the pur-
suit change.

IRE and NICAR offer resources for
journalists who want to use data to
probe law enforcement and crime.
In the months since that report came out,
we hear the change when we listen to
the scanner. An officer will radio in that
he or she is behind a car that's not stop-
ping. The supervisor will ask what the
suspect is wanted for. Many times, if it's
minor, the supervisor will tell them to stop.
They are also quick to stop pursuits if
the speeds start getting too high or traf-
fic conditions change.
