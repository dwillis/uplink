Campaigns
Uplink update

Computers are emerging as a
new-age voting machine, and elec-
tions may never be the same.

This issue of Uplink profiles
computer-assisted efforts, and of-
fers tips for reporters to better cover
campaigns. That includes using the
Internet as well as using campaign
contribution data.

For instance, in Oregon, report-
ers cajoled U.S. Senate candidates
to release computerized contribu-
tion data before the Federal Elec-
tion Commission's deadline. That
meant voters knew days before they
went into the booth who was pay-
ing for each candidate's campaign.

At the Syracuse (N.Y.) Post-
Standard, the newspaper used the
Internet on election night to give
up-to-the-minute tallies for every
local race.

We also offer a smorgasbord of
web sites for campaign reporting
- everything from voting records
to speeches.

Finding the best politicans money can buy
Money-go-round

By David Royse
Associated Press.

Campaign finance data. To para-
phrase Jimmy Buffett: We all want it,
we've all got it. Now, what do we do
with it?

"There are a thousand stories that
will jump off anybody's desk," says
Josh Goldstein, research director at the
Center for Responsive Politics, which
tracks campaign giving. "You don'thave
enough time in the day to do all the
stories that are out there."

Larry Makinson, a former Anchor-
age Daily News reporter who also works
at the Center for Responsive Politics,
wrote the book "Follow the Money." He
says looking at campaign giving can
shed light on the real candidate.

"The issues that a candidate talks
about in targeting these contributors are
often totally different from the issues
they talk about to the public," Makinson
writes. "Exposing the details of this phan-
tom campaign — and identifying the
players - provides a much more fully-
rounded picture of the candidate and the
positions he or she will take once they
attain office."

Debunking candidates

The most important money profiles
can debunk candidates' attempts to por-
tray themselves as something they are
not. For example, consider this lede from
a 1988 story about presidential candi-
date Richard Gephardt:

"Rep. Richard Gephardt, who is seek-
ing to craft an image as an anti-establish-
ment, anti-corporate crusader, has raised
far more money from political action
committees than any of his Democratic
rivals - much of it from the very inter-
ests he rails against on the stump.”

Divulging the corporate support for
Gephardt revealed his populism as a
born-again-type, the writer implied, thus
preventing Gephardt from running two
campaigns — one for the readers of the

Pulitzer winner calculates justice
Virgin
territory

By Andrew W. Lehren
NICAR staff

Sometimes, for a Pulitzer Prize-
winning story, you need to bang your
computer with a screwdriver.

That's what Melvin Claxton found
out at the Virgin Islands Daily News.
But this gets ahead of the tale.

The newspaper won a 1995
Pulitzer for exposing how the crimi-
nal justice system failed to work in
the Caribbean paradise. Police and
prosecutors failed time and again to
put criminals in jail. Most major
crimes went unsolved. Claxton found
rampant corruption and incompe-
tence. Even when prosecutors did
win convictions, criminals rarely did
time in jail.

From page one: Calculating justice

Claxton also used something government
officials had ignored: a computer.

His tabulations were startling. Fewer than
five of every 100 violent crimes reported to
police led to an arrest. Fewer than 10 of every
100 were even investigated. About two-fifths
of all violent crime cases were dismissed be-
fore going to trial, often at the request of
prosecutors. Fewer than a third of all con-
victed criminals went to prison.

Claxton wove these facts into compelling
stories that dramatized how the system failed
in the U.S. territory. His series was rich with
anecdotes and detail. But the computer analy-
sis, he said, was the most important part.

"It was the bottom line," the reporter said.

The series began after a new editor, Lowe
Davis, talked with Claxton about possible long-
term projects. Claxton already knew of count-
less tales of police work gone wrong, how
evidence got lost, how unqualified people got
key police jobs.

To widen the scope of the story, Claxton
began looking at the system itself. That in-
cluded examining stacks of court records that
tracked charges, disposition and sentences.
The government system was in such disarray
that officials could not recount how many
rapes they prosecuted in 1994.

Claxton answered those questions by build-
ing his own spreadsheet.

Claxton, an Antigua native, received his
college degree in economics. He knew some-
thing about numbers and, he said, "I've always
been a Mac buff and always keep my personal
bills in the computer."

Paper records

With help from two interns, the reporter got
paper records from the U.S. territorial courts in
St. Thomas and St. Croix. In one case, because
court clerks photocopied the wrong pages, he
needed to revisit court files to make sure he got
the right information.

Claxton used Excel to record more than
5,000 cases. The information included 10 col-
umns — all the information kept in the court
disposition listings. The records included a
case number, the charges, the offender's sex,
whether the case was decided by a judge or a
jury, and what happened. The most useful
information flowed from the last column, labeled
"Dispositions." It was a collection of notes. It.
included notes like "Gov't not prepared for trial,"
"Dismissed by motion of the Government," and
"Dismissed by the Government."

In addition, the reporter gathered police records,
including arrest logs. He had planned beforehand
how to build the spreadsheets. "We decided what
we are looking for, and what averages we would
love to know." Those figures included the crime
rate, the number of criminal court cases, and the
percentage of convictions.

Claxton typed in the records. "I sure would
have loved for the government to have done this,"
he said. But few public records are computerized
in the U.S. Territory. He had no choice if he
wanted the story.

Claxton worked on an old Macintosh SE30. It
was the best computer at the newspaper. That's
not saying much, considering what is in many big
U.S. newsrooms. To make things worse, the com-
puter kept crashing. The problem was a hard drive
that got stuck when it should have been spinning
around for data. "That was a dark side of the
story," Claxton recalled. "It gave us some fright-
ening moments."

A repairman, after several failed attempts to
fix it, offered sage advice: Take off the back panel
and whack the hard drive with a screwdriver.

He offered them a shiny screwdriver with a
black, rubber handle.

The solution was brutal, but got the job done.

Just to make sure, Claxton printed out every
day's work. The results were shocking — so
unusual that Claxton recounted everything twice
before discussing them with public officials.

Police officers said they had no way to verify
or dispute the findings. Judges and prosecutors, at
first disbelieving, sought printouts for review.

The calculations brought depth to the anec-
dotes. When he started the story, he said, "what
we didn't have was the quantified numbers." But
with those figures, the result "was a quantified
rather than a subjective story."

The newspaper has since replaced the troubled
hard drive. Claxton kept it as a souvenir. The
repairman got his screwdriver back.

In December, Claxton left the newspaper to
finish a true-crime book set in the Virgin Islands.

Building your own database
Hard-copy hints

By Jennifer LaFleur
San Jose Mercury News

Build your own database.

The phrase strikes terror in the minds of
journalists who suddenly picture themselves
locked in a padded room typing numbers for
weeks on end, never seeing daylight.

As much as we strive to get government
offices to provide information electronically, it
is not always possible. Sometimes journalists
must build their own database from hard-copy
documents.

Carolyn Tufts, when she was a reporter for
the Belleville (Ill.) Democrat, spent her free time
entering information from thousands of traffic
tickets into a database.

Robert Imrie, an Associated Press reporter in
Wausau, Wis., wanted to analyze deer hunting
accidents, but only had hard-copy forms — so he
build his own database. Ralph Frammolino, a
reporter for the Los Angeles Times built a data-
base from juror questionnaires in the Simpson
trial.

Building your own database also can be use-
ful to keep track of information we get into our
newsrooms regularly: accidents, homicides or
other crime incidents. If you input these items as
they come in, eventually you'll have a database
you can use to look at trends.

Input options

In cases where large amounts of data must be
entered, the reporter doesn't always have the
time to become a full-time data entry person.
Here are some options:

• Use a professional data-entry company.
They are usually quite efficient and not expen-
sive. In many cases, you can have these compa-
nies "double-enter" the data. This means that
two people enter the data, then cross-check the
two files.

• Use a temporary service. This requires that
you train the temp on how to properly enter the
data or create a simple data-entry form. This also
requires regular spot-checks of the data.

• Do it yourself in your spare time. Especially
on your first projects, this will help you inter-
view the data.

Once you get ready to build the database,
here are some dos and don'ts to keep in mind:

Dos and Don'ts

• Break up names into separate fields for
first, last, and middle or middle initial.

• Plan. Plan. Plan. If your set up your data-
base for U.S. addresses, will there ever be a
point when you'll be putting foreign addresses
in the database? If yes, create a field for country.
In many database programs you can give these
fields a "default" value. That means the com-
puter would automatically put USA in the coun-
try field unless you specified something differ-
ent.

• Will you want to look at the data by day of
the week or month? You may want to break up
the date into three parts or add a separate field
for day of the week.

• Be consistent. If you're typing in city
names or streets, use the same format each time.
Use all upper case to avoid problems with case-
sensitivity.

• Enter some of the data, then have a col-
league look at the data. This is a good way to test
the database to make sure it's easy to under-
stand and they may suggest other information to
include.

• Balance. Don't include so much that it
takes you the next 10 years to enter the data, but
include that data you think you "might" use: It's
easier to input it the first time around.

• If you're entering the data yourself, have
someone else spot check from the original form.

• Get a summary report based on the forms
you're using. This can help you check the totals
in your database.

• Do some basic integrity checks on the data:
Check for duplicates, count fields and look for
inconsistencies. For example, if you were in-
putting accidents, does your database use I-70
and I 70 and Interstate 70?

• In Paradox: check mark these fields indi-
vidually and CALC COUNT ALL, then sort
alphabetically.

• In FoxPro and Access: group by these
fields individually, COUNT them, then sort or
order by alphabetically.

• Backup your database frequently.

Public-interest contributions and the candidates
Linking money before the vote

By Dan Mihalopoulos
St. Louis Post-Dispatch

It's good to know who gave how much and
to which candidate, even when an election is
over. It's much better still when you can have
that information before voters decide.

That's a luxury Oregon journalists enjoyed
during the campaign to replace Sen. Bob
Packwood.

With help from the Center for Responsive
Politics, reporters at The Oregonian and
Willamette Week, an alternative weekly, linked
candidates with contributions from interest
groups and industries. All of this was done
before voters needed to turn in their special,
mail-in ballots.

"This was the first attempt to do real-time
reporting and get a handle on the money before
elections," said Larry Makinson, deputy direc-
tor of the center in Bandon, Ore. "I'm not
aware that anyone has done that before in a
federal race."

Working independently, Steve Suo of The
Oregonian and Bob Young of Willamette Week
convinced the candidates to disclose their con-
tribution records ahead of the Federal Election
Commission's deadline.

Identifying contributors

This allowed Makinson to do what he does
best — identify individual contributors with
interest groups or industries and determine
where the money really is coming from.

"The only way is to browbeat the candi-
dates into releasing the information," Makinson
said. "They don't like to share information if
they can get away with it."

The Oregonian and Willamette Week then
analyzed the databases and did stories that
identified one candidate, Rep. Ron Wyden, as
the favorite of former Packwood contributors.

"We took some hits for that story," Suo
said. "Some felt it was an unfair comparison,
but that's what the numbers showed. That's
not to say that Wyden is a sexual harasser.
Packwood had an incredible ability to raise
money, and we showed that Wyden will inherit
that legacy."

The Oregonian's Washington bureau had
compiled Packwood's FEC reports from 1979.
Suo used Access to join the table of Packwood
contributors to the candidate tables. The query
yielded nearly 200 hits.

At Willamette Week, Young used an Excel
spreadsheet in a similar story on. Wyden's
Packwood connection.. He superimposed the
Packwood data onto the recent list of campaign
contributors. Young then scrolled down the new
list, noting the one-time Packwood contributors
that had been active in the campaign.

Simple analysis of the data also showed which
candidates received the most money from
women's groups, pro-Israel PACs and the timber,
insurance and health-care industries.

"Normally, we follow the FEC deadlines and
there is a mad scramble to get a list of the biggest
contributors," Suo said. "There's never been an
attempt to make a comprehensive analysis of
where the money was coming from. This allowed
us to go a little deeper."

Scanning sees the light

The Oregonian had first crack at the data
because Suo scanned in the paper records. Only
one candidate handed over information in an
electronic format.

"It wasn't difficult to scan individual dona-
tions into the database," Suo said. "Using simple
macros, we got the information in tab-delimited
format and got it into the database. It was much,.
much faster than data entry by keyboard."

Some candidates were unwilling to give the
journalists data on disk although they had all the
information on a computer, Suo said. The cam-
paigns feared that the competition would acquire
their lists and use them to raise money.

With scanning technology, however, "hand-
ing it to us on paper is as good as on disk," Suo
said. "They were in the dark on the state of
technology."

If data is unavailable on disk, he suggested, the
next best thing is to convince the campaign to
create a paper form that is scanner-friendly.

Regardless, duplicating the impressive effort
in Oregon is not difficult with a little bit of
computer savvy, Makinson said.

"A small paper with one inquisitive reporter
can unravel patterns that were totally invisible a
few years ago," he said. "You can have an incal-
culable impact, especially if you do it before the
election."

On the World Wide Web
Many happy returns

By Tom Foster
The (Syracuse, N.Y.) Post-Standard

The Syracuse Newspapers used a multilay-
ered approach to report 1995 election results to
their central New York readers in real time.

Using NewsLine, the newspapers' audiotext
service, and Syracuse OnLine, the newspapers'
World Wide Web site (www.syracuse.com),
the newspapers delivered up-to-the minute re-
turns on everything from the county executive
campaign to dozens of town council races.

The newspapers used three terminals con-
nected via modem to Onondaga County's Board
of Elections mainframe to monitor results in
real time. Those were transferred by typists to a
master Paradox database of results that resided
on the newsroom's Novell network.

Getting results

Once the results were on the newspapers' PC
network, those single keystrokes did a lot of
things at the same time. Results were posted at
our web site. The newsroom as a whole was able
to track the evening's events. And reporters got
instant printouts for the races they were cover-
ing. Here are the details:

• Internet documents: Paradox's report writ-
ing functions allow HTML tags to be built into
templates. Using templates makes it easy to
accommodate changing data. The functions let
us create HTML documents containing the lat-
est results on the fly by telling Paradox to make
the right web page.

We had to prepare. Prior to the election,
fields in the Paradox table had been filled in
with the names of the HTML files for the fact
boxes, profiles and preview stories for each
race. That let us publish more than just numbers.
On election night, the files were sent to an
update folder on the newsroom network, where
they were transferred to the web server.

• Newsroom updates: Real-time electronic
updates were available to all reporters and edi-
tors. One newsroom PC running Netscape was
hooked up to a TV mounted above the city desk.
That allowed point-and-click access to results
that could be viewed by dozens of people at
once. To speed things up, the PC connected to
the television was used to monitor the results
file from the newsroom network rather than our
web server.

• Customized reports: To keep reporters who
were working on the more than 140 races effi-
ciently updated, the Paradox table also included
a field listing the name of the reporter covering
the race. A Paradox script triggered paper print-
outs so each reporter received a report listing
results on just the races that reporter covered.

A Paradox script running in the background
generated automatically all of the HTML and
paper reports. That script monitored the system
clock and triggered updates every 10 minutes. It
allowed the typists, reporters and editors to
work without interruption throughout the night.

What we learned

Generally, the process worked smoothly.
We usually were able to pass results from the
board of elections mainframe to our staff and
online users within five minutes. The ability to
update all races simultaneously tended to put us
ahead of broadcast media. A local public radio
station used our web page as a source of its
report to listeners. The Board of Elections also
monitored our page and referred callers to our
site. There is always room for improvement.
We confined our updates for Onondaga County
to one file that was fairly large, about 49K.
That's with no images. Because we only had to
replace one file, that sped up our ability to
update our site. Its size meant reloading via
modem took an annoyingly long time in some
cases. This was particularly true when using
America OnLine's browser.

On the newsroom side, we learned the hard
way that low-tech approaches can be more
effective. On election night in 1994, reporters
got an icon on their PCs that allowed them to
monitor the master Paradox results table as it
was updated. Two problems arose: Some re-
porters weren't comfortable multitasking, so
they would view the results, take notes by hand
and then exit that application to write. And
when about 35 reporters tried to run Paradox
over the network at the same time, the load
brought traffic to a crawl and finally a crash.

We used paper reports this year to guard
against network overload, but it turned out that
most reporters were more comfortable with that
system anyway.

From page one: Best votes money can buy

stump speeches, and one for the PAC represen-
tatives and Washington lobbyists. A closely
related type of story is one that exposes what
Makinson: calls the "cash constituents." Are
these large contributors the people the elected
officials really serve? There's one way to find
out, Goldstein suggests.

"Look at who carried water for what indus-
tries on specific amendments?" For example,
Goldstein suggests, "take a small element of
the farm bill and look at who (among contribu-
tors) got something back."

Bangs for the bucks

Some of the most interesting political sto-
ries are those that open up the "back rooms"
and point to connections between campaign
financing and precise pieces of legislation.
One such story, and one of the best ex-
amples of cash constituent coverage is an Oc-
tober 1995 Boston Globe story by Michael
Kranish. The piece begins:

"Three weeks ago, Sen. Bob Dole launched
his latest drive to save tax preferences worth
billions of dollars for the ethanol industry. He
sent letters, held private meetings with lobby-
ists, pressured fellow Republicans and ulti-
mately helped turn back a House revolt against
the tax break." Kranish then outlines the cozy
relationship between Dole and Dwayne
Andreas, chairman of agri-business giant Ar-
cher Daniels Midland. ADM and a couple of
other companies would see more than $600
million in savings from the ethanol tax breaks.

"Over the past 14 years," writes Kranish,
"Andreas' family and company have given
more than $250,000 to Dole's campaign commit-
tees and foundations."

Such in-depth reporting is not always needed.
Simply reporting lists of campaign contributors
and their affiliations, although not necessarily as
captivating as deeper investigative pieces, can
give the reader an idea of where a candidate gets
support.

Go local

The Courier Journal of Louisville, Ky., re-
cently began routinely reporting the sources of all
campaign contributions to statewide candidates.
Sometimes the stories may seem a little dull.
Consider this headline from the coverage of the
1995 governor's race: "Optometrists are leading
Patton donors; also gave heavily to Forgy." But
they show the reader who are the cash constitu-
ents.

This year, another good local story, says
Goldstein, is to look at the money going from the
circulation area to the presidential campaigns.
"It's time for folks to start making that a local
story... showing who the national cash constitu-
ents are locally. That's not going to win you a
Pulitzer, but it's a good local story."

Goldstein also suggests looking at the cam-
paign expenditures of members of Congress.
"You're looking for stuff that looks unusual,"
Goldstein says. He cited the case of one member
whose campaign had spent $8,500 on clocks,
according to her FEC expenditure reports. "What
is a campaign doing spending $8,500 on clocks,"
Goldstein asks. "An enterprising reporter asked
the store that, and they said, 'No, nobody's spent
that much here.' That's a story."

From page four: Linking contributions

But the key is to get the candidates to
disclose before the law forces them to. Young
and Suo recommend approaching the most
amenable campaign first.

"Peter DeFazio agreed on a Monday
morning. Once I got him, it was like domi-
nos," Young recalled. "It was not hard to do it. I had it sewn up in one day."

Makinson promised to apply much of what
he learned in the special Senate race to the 1996
elections. Contributions to presidential hope-
fuls and candidates for a few Senate seats will
be likely subjects of pre-election scrutiny next
year.

Follow the money

Mother Jones put together a wonderful site
on following campaign spending: "The Best
Congress Money Can Buy" which lets you plug
in the name of a candidate and search 1991-
1994 PAC contributions and '91-'92 individual
contributions. The results come in a bar graph
with the special interest group's contribution
charted with other PACs. This great application
is at http://www.mojones.com/coinop_congress/
data_viewer/data_viewer.html

Check out C-Span's campaign contribution
site at gopher://c-span.org:70/11/Resource/fec.
It includes tables that show PAC contributions
to legislators.

Also, the Federal Election Commission's
new ftp site offers extensive summary data in
zipped files at ftp://ftp.fec.gov. Use the program
PKUnzip to pull out the tables that show, for
instance, how much each PAC spent. Save the
text files that explain how the data was put
together.

Putting the heat on pensions

At New York Newsday, reporter Joe Calderone wrote
about certain firefighters who seemed to have won exces-
sive disability pensions.

When the newspaper closed, he moved over to the New
York Daily News, and continued his investigation with
another ex-Newsday reporter, Russ Buettner. Together,
they decided to probe the entire disability pension system
for firefighters.

"We wanted to look at the context of what was going
on," Buettner said.

The reporters negotiated more than three months with
the New York State Comptroller, using the state freedom
of information law, for firefighter pension data. The
database included more than 14,000 retirees, and about
seven columns of information.

The reporters, already familiar with much about how
the pension system worked and how the information was
coded, needed about two days to analyze the data using
FoxPro. "The analysis was simple," according to Buettner.

The result was a story that ran Dec. 18 showing how
one of every two ex-firefighters collected disability pen-
sions. That included the fire department's own retired
doctors.

Also, nearly four of every 10 pocketed lucrative line-
of-duty pensions. That included one firefighter who in-
jured his ankle after tripping on a crack in the sidewalk
outside a firehouse.

The reporters also showed how the Fire Department
brass won line-of-duty benefits more than front-line
firefighters. And New York firefighters won line-of-duty
pensions more often than their counterparts in the state's
other big cities. That point was highlighted with a chart that
showed New York's wide gap with Yonkers, Buffalo,
Rochester and Syracuse.

Reisner new training director

The National Institute for Computer-Assisted Report-
ing has appointed Neil Reisner as its training director.

Reisner will be in charge of NICAR's on-the-road
training seminars that last year provided training for more
than 3,000 journalists throughout the country. He will
report to Brant Houston, NICAR's managing director.

An award-winning journalist with two decades of expe-
rience and a journalism educator, Reisner most recently
served as database editor with The Bergen Record of
Hackensack, N.J. During six years there he served in The
Record's statehouse bureau and as a regional reporter.
Reisner previously worked at The Home News in New
Brunswick, N.J.

He has taught journalism at Columbia University's
Graduate School of Journalism and at Rutgers University.
