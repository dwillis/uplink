CRIME
Tracing guns

By David Olinger
The Denver Post
We responded to the Columbine High
massacre last April in part by putting a spot-
light on the firearms trade, particularly the
accessibility of guns to kids and convicted
felons.
Two results of that effort appeared in The
Denver Post in September and December,
each as a three-day series. The first described
how used police guns had become a primary
source of high-capacity magazines, banned
from manufacture in 1994 but legal to pos-
sess today, and how thousands of old police

CRIMINAL JUSTICE
The escape
problem

By Jack Dolan
Hartford Courant
A throwaway paragraph caught our
eye in one of the dozens of stories about
the killing of eight-year-old murder wit-
ness "BJ" Brown, and the arrest of sus-
pect Adrian Peeler.
Buried amid the outcries for a new,
centralized state-level witness protection
program lurked an interesting, and
wholly ignored, piece of information: at
the time of the killing Peeler was offi-
cially listed as escaped from a Depart-
ment of Correction halfway house.
A three-month investigation that
started with the DOC inmate database
showed that the department routinely al-
lowed prisoners to walk away from half-
way houses and home release supervi-
sion long before their sentences were fin-
ished. Instead of looking for the "es-
capce," wardens were instructed to fill

guns were getting traced as crime guns. The
second, called "The Gun Pipeline," detailed
how homicides, assaults, the shooting of a
federal agent and the pistol taken from a 13-
year-old cocaine dealer could all be traced to
multiple handgun sales.
Both sets of stories relied on databases
from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms as primary sources of informa-
tion.

Trace database
Paying for the databases was the easy part.
We got two for $75 - one consisting of guns
that ATF was asked to trace from 1994
through 1998, the other a compendium of
multiple handgun sales reported to ATF from
1995 through 1997.
The hard part was using them to find
criminal cases that could be explored as po-
tential news stories. This was especially true
of the gun-tracing database we received last
summer. It showed when each gun was re-
covered; the manufacturer, model and cali-
ber of the gun; an NCIC crime code, indi-
cating the suspected crime associated with
the gun; usually the local ATF office that
handled the trace request, sometimes the city
and state where the gun was recovered, and
on rare occasions, the height, weight, sex and
race of the suspect. It excluded, among other
things, the serial numbers of the guns, the
firearms dealers who sold them and any ex-
planation of the crime and completion codes.
We were particularly interested in the S5
completion code, which meant the gun had
been traced to a police agency that sold it.
The database showed nearly 3,000 guns from
1994-1998 had an S5 code. But then we had
to find sources outside ATF who could con-
firm that this was indeed the "police" code,
and who provided us a list of NCIC crime

Tracing guns

codes. At that point the reporting effort
became a matter of calling police departments
all over the country and asking them if they
could pinpoint the crime associated with
their seizure of a Glock 9 mm handgun on a
particular date. Especially in the cities, this
request often went nowhere. Large police
departments recover a lot of Glocks, and they
don't have a convenient way to search for
them without a serial number or a suspect's
name.
Ultimately we needed help from friendly
ATF sources, from police departments small
enough to remember a murder or a suicide
on a particular date, and from Joseph Vince,
a former director of ATF's national tracing
center, now a consultant who runs Crime
Gun Solutions in Maryland. The data also
led us to a couple of lucky hits. In Colorado,
one puzzle concerned the apparent trace of
16 "crime guns" sold by a police agency in a
small town. It turned out to be an ATF in-
vestigation of an indicted undersheriff trad-
ing weapons with an indicted gun dealer.

Two cautions
First, we found a number of cases where
guns were not used to commit the crimes
listed in the tracing request. For example, one
police department traced the weapon of an
officer slain on duty, yet it appeared in the
database as a homicide gun traced to a police
agency. Secondly, the S5 code gives only a
rough indication of the number of used po-
lice guns that become the object of police
trace requests.
At one time ATF called police agencies to
notify them that one of their guns had been
traced and to ask who bought it. That caused
the "completion code" to go beyond the po-
lice agency and reduced the apparent num-
ber of police weapons picked up at crime
scenes. Also, keep in mind that a fraction of
guns seized by police agencies get traced.
ATF has since agreed to provide more in-
formation in its gun-tracing database, includ-
ing serial numbers. But it also structured its
data release to block comparisons of traced
guns and multiple sales, presumably because
some multiple sales have led to ongoing
criminal investigations.

Multiple sales data
After struggling to extract nuggets of in-
formation from ATF's database of traced
guns, we found its multiple handgun sales
database a comparative gold mine. It shows
the dealers, the serial numbers and a buyer
ID number for each purchase, which enabled
us to see how many and what guns were in-
volved in every multiple handgun purchase
reported by a firearms dealer.
Querying the data, we quickly learned
which states - and which dealers - reported
the most multiple handgun sales from 1995-
1997, along with the kinds of handguns that
each dealer sold to people buying two – or
two dozen - at once. We learned that a Colo-
rado state agency kept a database of im-
pounded police guns, and though it was
woefully incomplete, we used it to find about
100 cases where handguns bought by mul-
tiple purchasers were seized in criminal ar-
rests.
We began by looking for links between
multiple handgun sales and gun trafficking
to criminals. In the end we concluded there
was a much stronger connection if we lim-
ited our inquiry to multiple sales of "Satur-
day Night Specials." For that purpose we re-
lied on the "Saturday Night Special" ordi-
nances of California cities to develop a list of
nine popular brands of cheap handguns. One
startling result: a tiny pawnshop specializing
in cheap semi-automatic pistols had sold 40
percent of all the weapons we could trace
from crime scenes to multiple handgun sales
in Colorado.
ATF's multiple sales data, like its gun trac-
ing data, provide an incomplete picture.
Many multiple handgun sales - including
one California dealer's sale of 253 guns to a
group who distributed them to Los Angeles
gang members – never were reported and re-
corded in the database as a set of multiple
sales.

GUNS
Advice from the front

By Sarah Cohen
The Washington Post
Just about this time last year, The Wash-
ington Post - like many other news organiza-
tions - began requesting data on crime guns
from the federal Alcohol, Tobacco and Fire-
arms agency of the Treasury Department.
After an eight-month battle with the
agency, we published a story linking eight
former police weapons in the District of
Columbia to homicides. The story, "Recycled
D.C. Police Guns Tied to Crimes," described
more than 100 crimes tied to weapons once
owned by the D.C. police. During this time,
the city was paying residents to turn in their
guns and was enforcing the strictest gun laws
in the nation - a virtual ban on all handguns
in the city.
For years, the ATF had logged guns re-
covered by local police agencies. It recorded
information about the gun, the person caught
with the gun and the suspected crime. The
database is mainly used to help local police
trace the history of guns they recover. ATF
claims it is also used to identify rogue dealers
who are suspected of breaking federal laws
in selling weapons.
The story idea was simple - how does a
good gun turn bad? Where does it go down
the road to crime? The answer, we found,
was that it sometimes goes bad when it is
traded back to manufacturers from police
departments, a lucrative deal for cash-
strapped police and for the manufacturers.
The good news is that any news organi-
zation can now get the database we - and
others - fought so hard to open. There's a
strong argument that ATF is still withhold-
ing too much information, such as the iden-
tity of the dealers who sold the guns and the
name of the police agency that requested in-
formation about it. But the web of informa-
tion available can - especially in areas out-
side the D.C. area - be of use.
The two primary databases that ATF will
provide without a fight are what it considers
the public portions of the "Firearms Tracing
System," or FTS, and the multiple sales gun
database. Since our story ran, other news
organizations have simply requested the same
database provided to The Post and received it
without question for $75.

Here's what you'll get and how you can
use it:

Multiple Sales
I'm listing the multiple sales database first
because it will often be of more use for break-
ing stories in certain parts of the country.
Under federal law, dealers must record sales
of more than one gun in a week to any indi-
vidual. Those records are turned over to ATF,
which lost a lawsuit to keep them secret.
Under that ruling, the judge said that deal-
ers have no right to privacy under the law,
but left the door open to ATF to appeal it on
other grounds. The agency never did and the
ruling stands.
This database was of little use in our area
because all of our local states have had laws
prohibiting multiple sales for years. But, as
The Denver Post's David Olinger points out
in this issue, it can be of use to reporters in
Western and Southern states with fewer rules.
Multiple sales show the serial number,
make and model of the gun, the name of the
dealer, its ATF license number and the date
of the report to ATF. (The dealer has a month
to report it to the federal government.) Less
than 2 percent of all guns sold in the U.S.
are sold under these transactions, but law
enforcement officers and crime experts say
they are the source of a disproportionate
number of gun crimes. It's worth checking
this database whenever you have a serial num-
ber for a gun used in a crime.
In one part of our project, we tried to track
guns that had been recovered by police agen-
cies back to multiple sales, essentially trac-
ing guns that were used in crimes then sold
by the police. But the dates in the multiple
sales database were often garbled. In fact,
most large police agencies have stopped re-
selling recovered weapons, making anything
we did find less newsworthy anyway.

Trace data
The ATF trace database lists the serial
numbers of most guns traced by local law
enforcement agencies, their make and model,
the date of the trace and the date of the re-
covery, information about where the gun was
recovered and the crime it was suspected to
be involved in.

Hunting felons

By Janet Roberts
St. Paul Pioneer Press
The story had been done before, but it
was ripe for another visit: Convicted felons,
who aren't supposed to carry firearms, were
hunting in the Minnesota woods with guns.
The St. Paul Pioneer Press had to look no
further than Donald Blom, a suspect in
Minnesota's most intensely covered crime in
1999. Charged in the May 1999 abduction
and killing of a 19-year-old convenience store
clerk, Blom had a pistol, two shotguns and a
rifle hidden in his cabin.
Because of those guns, Blom - a convicted
sex offender - was found guilty last summer
of being a felon in possession of firearms.
Among the evidence presented at his federal
court trial: Blom's Minnesota hunting license
and the registration he filed after bagging a
deer.
We figured Blom wasn't the only felon
roaming the woods in flame-orange cloth-
ing. Two databases helped us confirm that:
one listing people who received special hunt-
ing permits from the state Department of
Natural Resources, the other a Bureau of
Criminal Apprehension database listing con-
victed felons. We matched names and birth
dates to find people listed in both files.

Narrowing list
From there, we narrowed the list. State
law says people convicted of certain violent
crimes are forbidden from possessing a fire-
arm within 10 years of their release from su-
pervision. Because we were unable to deter-
mine release dates from the conviction data,
we cast a narrower net, winnowing our list
to felons convicted of violent crimes within
the past 10 years.
We had to build our own lookup table of
violent crimes. Only certain convictions re-
sult in the loss of gun privileges. We built an
Access table of those crimes, then matched
them against our hunters' convictions.
Within an hour, we found 236 felons who
were not supposed to possess firearms but
had received hunting permits from the DNR.
Some had been convicted of multiple of-
fenses. Our cast of characters included rap-
ists, a murderer and others convicted of vio-
lent crimes such as aggravated assault, stalk-

ing, armed robbery and possessing a machine
gun.
The actual number of violent felons with
hunting permits is surely much higher. Be-
cause the state keeps computer records only
of special hunting permits - those for hunt-
ing bear, turkey, moose and female deer -
the newspaper was unable to run criminal
checks on the hundreds of thousands of other
hunters whose licenses are not computerized.
Also, our analysis was conservative. We
matched first, middle and last names. Felons
who didn't list their middle names on their
hunting permit applications didn't make our
list. And because we narrowed the list by the
felon's conviction date rather than release
date, we likely missed many other hunters
who are not yet eligible to carry a gun.

State response
Reporter Amy Mayron's story pointed out
that if the newspaper, in an hour's time, could
come up with more than 200 likely violators
of state and federal weapons laws, the state
could do the same. The state's response? They
don't have the time or manpower to do the
checks.
Their response had been the same two
years earlier, when Twin Cities television sta-
tion WCCO used the same databases to re-
port that convicted felons were getting hunt-
ing licenses and taking game with firearms.
The station's report featured a state lawmaker
who was outraged by the findings and vowed
to pass legislation to force state officials to
perform the checks.
Our reporter found that lawmaker
equally outraged when she told him that
two years later, nothing had changed. A
couple of days after our story ran, it was
easy to see why. The chairman of the Sen-
ate Environment and Natural Resources
Committee said he would block any bill
that would use hunting permits to check
for convicted felons with guns. Lawmak-
ers in Minnesota, where hunting is a rite
of passage, are not about to enforce gun
laws by snooping on hunters.
A couple of lessons from this story:
Don't be dissuaded from delving into a
database just because it's incomplete. Even
though the licenses of hundreds of thou-

HUNTING ACCIDENTS
Young hunters

By James E. Wilkerson
and David Washburn
The Morning Call
In terms of popularity, hunting in Penn-
sylvania ranks just behind a cold Rolling
Rock and just ahead of NASCAR, so getting
our hands on hunting accident statistics
seemed like a natural.
The Pennsylvania Game Commission had
a database of hunting accidents going back
to 1983. Getting the data from the commis-
sion was quite easy and it was relatively clean.
However, it was lacking some basic informa-
tion, meaning a couple of our story ideas were
killed right off the bat. For example, it didn't
contain information on alcohol involvement
in accidents. Nor did it contain information
about where on the body a person was shot
or any information that identified the indi-
viduals involved.

We saw a chance to clear
up a sometimes-fatal
misconception, but to
make it work we needed
a human story.

But the table did contain a wealth of other
information concerning every reported
shooting accident in the state going back to
1984. We had information about what they
were doing at the time of the shooting, the
cause, the topography of the area, whether
they were wearing required blaze orange and
their ages, among many other items.

Background
Hunting accident analysis has been well
covered by other papers, so James ran some
queries based on information we'd seen
featured in stories archived by IRE and
NICAR. He started with the types of guns
involved, peak periods, what types of ani-
mals the hunters were going after, etc.
Because neither of us are hunters, Dave
spent some time attending the hunter edu-

cation classes required for licensing.
After a couple of weeks we compared
notes, and one item stood out: Although
Dave's contacts insisted that younger hunt-
ers (17 and under) were the safest because
they'd more recently received instruction, the
data clearly showed that younger hunters
were much more likely to be involved in ac-
cidents, on both ends of the gun.
After consulting with our outdoors edi-
tor and confirming that top state officials, as
well as instructors, believed the myth about
young hunters, we had the premise of our
story. It appeared that even the state's top
game commission officials had bought into
the myth without checking their own records.
We saw a chance to clear up a sometimes-
fatal misconception, but to make it work we
needed a human story.

Beyond records
We matched dates and locations of the
incidents to our paper's computerized library
and homed in on some half-dozen incidents
involving young hunters. The first person we
contacted, a widow in Columbia County,
turned out to be the interview we needed to
make the story work. Her husband had been
accidentally shot and killed by their 12-year-
old son during their first hunting trip a few
years before.
That boy's experiences, just weeks after
he'd taken the state-mandated hunting safety
course, provided a springboard for us to ex-
amine hunting-safety instruction in Pennsyl-
vania and compare it to other states where
hunting is just as popular. The story showed
that our state was far behind many others
when it came to exposing students to gun-
safety programs.

Advice

One of the most contentious issues with
ATF was the "completion code." The data-
base lists about 100 different codes, for ex-
ample, "S4," to indicate whether the gun was
successfully traced. ATF argued that disclos-
ing these codes would be disclosing a national
secret. They eventually did identify the codes.
We knew that "S5" meant that the gun
was traced to a law enforcement agency, not
a private dealer or individual. In fact, we were
encouraged even before Columbine that we
had a story, since D.C. was the source of
many S5's. It turned out to be wildly inaccu-
rate and is a lesson in what flaws the trace
database has.
Another point of contention is the list of
serial numbers redacted. The ATF removed
any serial numbers that are included in the
multiple sales database for four years -- the
amount of time that they've been keeping
multiple sales.
And the ATF made it clear that it would
fight as much as it could to keep dealers' iden-
tities secret, despite the fact that these deal-
ers' names were already in the public eye
thanks to a study requested by an anti-gun
congressman.

Data Flaws
There are two big flaws in the database,
both related to how police agencies trace
guns.
In most police agencies that do 100 per-
cent tracing - that is, they trace every gun
they recover - the trace request is part of the
protocol in the property room. That means
there are two big problems with the trace.
First, the "crime" listed by the police may or
may not end up being the crime committed
with the gun. In fact, ATF defines ANY gun
recovered by police as a crime gun. Its argu-

ment is that leaving a gun out on the street is
illegal anywhere. So even found guns are as-
sociated with crimes.
For our story, this meant tracking down
the ballistics reports and the victims to make
sure that the guns we say were used to com-
mit homicides were actually the guns listed
in the trace data. (Everywhere else, we de-
scribed the guns as "connected with" or
"linked to" crimes.)
For our story, the other problem was how
manufacturers trace the guns. In fact, almost
all of the "S5" guns in D.C. were, in fact,
service weapons either shot at suspects or
discharged accidentally. But guns that had
been traded by the D.C. police didn't show
up as government weapons - the manufac-
turers gave ATF the most recent buyer, not
the original buyer. This is understandable,
but meant that the figures in the ATF data-
base for some areas will be wildly erroneous.
(This depends on how the guns were traded
back to manufacturers. If they went through
dealers, the figures for your area will prob-
ably be reasonably accurate.)

Other databases:
Like the Denver reporters, we found a
state database of as much or more use than
the ATF's. In Virginia, every gun recovered
by police in some counties had been typed
into a mirror system. This included the names
and dates of birth of the people the firearm
was taken from, along with a description of
what happened. Unlike the federal data, it
also listed the name of the police agency that
recovered the weapon, making the reporting
in that state much easier.

Continued from page four: Hunters
sands of Minnesota hunters never get en-
tered into a computer, those for more than
200,000 others do. Readers are smart enough
to understand that if we could delve into an
incomplete database and find 200 felons reg-
istered to hunt, there's likely a whole lot more
hunting felons out there.

And don't be afraid to revisit a story that
someone else has already done. Sometimes,
these stories are just as good the second time
around.

User-friendly forms

By David Herzog
Providence Journal
One of the things I've learned in my
few years on the Providence Journal inves-
tigative team is that for such a small state,
Rhode Island breeds some big corruption
cases. As the CAR specialist on the paper's
I-team, one of my roles is to gather the
data to help uncover wrongdoing and
make sure other reporters can get to it eas-
ily.
Not everyone working on these inves-
tigations wants to learn how to query da-
tabases, so I've used Microsoft Access to
create stand-alone programs that allow
reporters to point and click their way to
useful information.
Access provides all the tools to create
these programs and enough power to ac-
complish everything you need without re-
sorting to programming.
Before getting into the nuts and bolts
of creating a program, it's necessary to un-
derstand how you can design forms to cre-
ate screens for entering and querying data.
That's what this article is about. Once you
know how to create a form, it's easy to
learn how to create a program.
Forms are the building blocks of the
programs you create. You use the forms to
design screens for your program, enter data
into tables and query tables. Another is-
sue of Uplink will carry the details of mak-
ing forms work with other objects to cre-
ate the program.
Nearly every investigation relies on a
chronology to organize the story, so let's
use one to get started.
For this lesson, I'm using an Access da-
tabase file called apriltech.mdb, which you
can download from the NICAR web site
http://www.nicar.org. After downloading
the file, open it in Access. (I'm using Ac-
cess 97). You can open the Chronology
table in design view to look at the fields
and data types.
The simplest way to create a form is to
let the Form Wizard do the work, then
tweak the form manually. For this form
we want to make these three modifica-
tions: (1) Create a button to close the
form. (2) Create a "pick list" of story top-

ics. (3) Create a toolbar with buttons to
allow easy querying.

Create form
Create the form by clicking on the Forms
tab, then New. Pick Form Wizard, then se-
lect the Chronology table from the pick list
below. Click Ok. As you click the Next but-
tons, the Form Wizard will walk you through

FIRST VENTURE
Playing the lottery

By Mark Houser
Pittsburgh Tribune-Review
"Confronting the Numbers," a three-
month Pittsburgh Tribune-Review investiga-
tion of the Pennsylvania lottery, began by
confronting the kind of statistical conun-
drum that makes journalism such a fun job.
The main point of my first computer-
assisted reporting project was to see if the con-
ventional wisdom - that the poor gamble on
the lottery more than the rich - was true in
our metro area.
Not an easy question, it turned out.
There are essentially two ways to use state
data to determine who buys lottery tickets.
One relies on sales information. The
Pennsylvania Lottery will provide a spread-
sheet of annual lottery sales by retailer. The
spreadsheet includes the retailer's address, so
a CAR reporter can sum the sales data by zip
codes.

But numbers don't tell
the whole story.
Eventually, I had to put
the mouse down and pick
up the phone. I even had
to (gasp!) leave the
office.

Using demographic statistics, such as
Claritas data, it's easy to figure per capita
sales for a zip code, and compare that to
median incomes in the same neighbor-
hood.
The problem with this method is that
it can't determine whether most, all, or
none of a store's sales are to people who
live in the neighborhood. Maybe the store
is selling to commuters on their lunch
hour or on the way home from work.
Show a lottery official your sales-based
analysis, and he immediately will try to
shoot holes in it for that reason.

Alternate method
The other method focuses on winners. Lot-
teries have to report anyone who wins more
than $600 in a game to the IRS, and those
records are public.
Because winners are a random sample of
all players (if not, you've probably got a bigger
story on your hands), a CAR reporter can ex-
trapolate what share of sales comes from a given
neighborhood based on what share of winners
lives there.
The problem with this method is that $600
threshold. In Pennsylvania, the prize for hit-
ting the three-digit Daily Number on a $1
straight bet is $500. Those winners aren't re-
ported to the IRS.
Numbers games are extremely popular in
Pittsburgh, especially with its large elderly
population. They are the game of choice among
the heaviest players, the ones who collect lists
of lucky numbers they notice on license plates
or passing buses.
A Pennsylvania lottery official confirmed
to me that if savvy numbers players want to
bet $10 on 7-9-2 straight, they buy 10 $1 tick-
ets. That way, if they hit they get 10 $500 pay-
ments instead of a single pot of $5,000 that
will be reported to the IRS.
Given that choice, I opted to use the sales
method. It is more straightforward and easier
for readers to understand.
I eliminated from my analysis any ticket
sales in the downtown area or in the airport,
where sales were most likely to be to people
who didn't live nearby.
Though Pennsylvania is notoriously secre-
tive, they didn't balk at mailing the sales data
on two disks of Excel spreadsheets. Because the
data were statewide, I was able to give custom-
ized stats to sister papers in neighboring coun-
ties, allowing them to do similar stories.

The results
Surprise! Sales were highest in working class
neighborhoods, and lowest in the wealthier
suburbs.
Now comes the part most dangerous for
CAR geeks - getting buried in spreadsheets. I
made top ten lists of this, figured per capita of
that, made pie charts and line graphs and all
sorts of neat stuff. I became a data weasel.
But numbers don't tell the whole story.

Lottery

Eventually, I had to put the mouse down and
pick up the phone. I even had to (gasp!) leave
the office.
I visited the library and read what the ex-
perts and other pundits had to say about lot-
teries. I called the professors, the industry ex-
perts, and the state budget gurus. Several long
interviews and hundreds of inches of notes
yielded no quotes at all, but helped me under-
stand the subject.
I found out about a 1987 legislative resolu-
tion to study how much the lottery causes prob-
lem gambling - which the state has since ig-
nored.
Months of poking around caused some
leaks to spring. We got a tip that 15 employees
got custom Pennsylvania Lottery sportcoats,
purchased from the lottery director's tailor,
costing the state $500 each.
I visited a Gamblers Anonymous meeting in a
church basement in the neighborhood where sales
are highest. There I met several self-professed lot-
tery addicts who were surprised and angry to hear
the state director and revenue secretary both
claimed such people did not exist.

At the region's top-selling store, our pho-
tographer met a poor family that spends $9 a
day on tickets- two bucks for Mom and Dad,
and one for each of their seven children. Their
story sold the package and generated the most
response from our readers.
I waited until late in the game to go to the
capital and interview the bigwigs. By that time,
I had a lot of pointed questions ready, and was
able to anticipate likely evasions and press for
further explanations.
The state still has a lottery; I don't think
any revelations are likely to change that. But
as a result of our story, the state legislature held
hearings to review the lottery's financial health,
which our package called into question. Soon
after, the auditor general announced his office
would launch a formal audit.
And the lottery director caught a tremen-
dous amount of flak for those jackets. Three
months after the series ran, he resigned, citing
a need to spend more time with his family.

BEGINNER TIPS
Text to date

Here are versions in Access and FoxPro
for converting character fields, such as
"01021999" to a true date field, "01/02/
1999."
No matter what program you're using,
start by inserting a new field in your table.
In this example, the original date field is
called DOB and the newly created field is
called BIRTHDT. The date appears as
mmddyyyy.

In Access:
In the grid view, put the name of the new
field, BIRTHDT, in the field grid.
In the criteria line:
Left([DOB],2) & "/" & Mid([DOB],3,2)
& "/" & Mid([DOB],5,4)

The SQL version looks like this:
UPDATE [TABLENAME] SET BIRTHDT=
Left([DOB],2) & "/" & Mid([DOB],3,2)

& "/" & Mid([DOB],5,4)
This tells the computer, start at the left
side of the DOB field and take two digits,
then insert a forward slash (/), then go to
the middle of the DOB field and start at
the third position and take two digits, then
insert another forward slash and finally go
to the middle of the DOB field and start
at the fifth position, taking four digits.
If your date has only two digits for the
year, replace the final 4 with a 2.
Make sure to use the ampersand (&)
and not the plus sign.

In FoxPro:
Here's the SQL (notice slightly different
syntax):
Replace all BIRTHDT with;
CTOD(substr(DOB,1,2) + "/" +
substr(DOB,3,2) + "/" +
substr(DOB,5,4))

QUICK TIP
Trimming spaces

Editor's note: This is an Access module Tom
McGinty, ahe IRE and NICAR Training Direc-
tor, found on the Microsoft Web site and recently
posted on the NICAR-L listserv.

This module will trim leading and trailing
spaces in a field, as well as extra spaces between
words.
For example, it will turn "(space) Tom
(space)(space)(space)McGinty(space)" into
"Tom(space)McGinty".

To find the Microsoft article about this
module, go to www.microsoft.com/
directory and click on "Searchable
Knowledge Database." Search for story
number Q148396. From there you can
copy and paste this module directly into
Access.

Here's how the module works:
Go to the module tab on your database
window and click on the "new" button.
The window that pops up should have
the following two lines at the top:
Option Compare Database
Option Explicit
If it does not, add them. Next, type the
following syntax below those two lines:

Function StripExtraChars (PassedStr,
RemoveExtraChar$)
On Local Error GoTo
stripExtraChars_Err
Dim i As Integer, GotChar As Integer
Dim HoldStr As String, HoldChar As
String
'Exit if passed value is Null.
If IsNull (PassedStr) Then Exit
Function
'Trim extra characters from passed
'string.
PassedStr = Trim$(PassedStr)
'Cycle through string and remove
'extra string characters specified in
'the RemoveExtraChar value.
For i = 1 To Len(PassedStr)
HoldChar = Mid$(PassedStr, i, 1)
If HoldChar = RemoveExtraChar

Then
If GotChar = False Then
GotChar = True
HoldStr = HoldStr & HoldChar
End If
Else
GotChar = False
End If
If Not GotChar Then
HoldStr = HoldStr & HoldChar
End If
Next i
StripExtraChars = HoldStr
StripExtraChars_End:
Exit Function
StripExtraChars_Err:
MsgBox Error$
Resume StripExtraChars_End
End Function

Next, under the "Debug" menu, choose
"Compile and save all modules." It will prompt
you to name the module. Name it
"TrimSpaces" and then close the module.
Now, let's say you have a field called NAME
that has extra spaces between first and last
names, and unwanted spaces at the beginning
and end of some of the names. First, create a
new field in your table called
"NEWNAME" (NEVER change your original
data).
Then start a new query, add your table to
the query and then, under the "Query" menu,
choose "Update Query." Pull the
"NEWNAME" field down into the "Field"
row of the update query. Then type this in the
"Update To:" row of the query:

StripExtraChars([NAME], Chr$(32))

That applies the new module you just cre-
ated to the NAME field and puts the results
into the NEWNAME field. The second ar-
gument of the function, Chr $(32)), is the
ASCII code for spaces.
The SQL for the same update query
would look like this:
update TABLENAME set NEWNAME =
StripExtraChars([NAME], Chr$(32))

EDUCATION
Impact of choice

By Griff Palmer
The Daily Oklahoman
In the past five years, the Oklahoma City
school district has, with growing enthusiasm,
embraced the "choice school movement."
The growth of the movement has coincided
with the dismantling of the district's court-
ordered busing system and a return to neigh-
borhood schools, many of them with student
bodies that are 90 percent or more black.
Oklahoma City's choice schools are widely
viewed as unqualified successes. But dissent-
ing voices have argued that the establishment
of choice schools, catering to elite students,
imposes a cost on other students.

Block group-level income
and education data
served as rough
indicators of individual
students' socioeconomic
status. This method
allowed us to make
observations based on
the socioeconomic status
of the block groups in
which students lived, but
not on individual
students.

Education reporter Bobby Ross and I de-
cided to put a yardstick to the debate: Are
choice schools having an impact on other
schools in Oklahoma City? How much of
an impact? What are the implications? Our
measurement tools included FoxPro, Excel,
SPSS and Atlas GIS.
We found that students attending Okla-
homa City's choice schools are disproportion-

ately white, and are drawn disproportionately
from the city's wealthiest, best-educated
neighborhoods. We also found that neigh-
borhood schools have greater concentrations
of minority students and poor students than
live within those schools' attendance bound-
aries. This bleeding off of talent from the
wealthiest neighborhoods has coincided with
a marked decline in standardized test scores
among students in neighborhood schools.

Data used
At the heart of our analysis was a data file
containing the home addresses and school
assignments of Oklahoma City's 40,000 stu-
dents.
Several fellow journalists expressed surprise
that we were able to get the school district to
give us this data. There is ample room, though,
under the Family Educational Rights and Pri-
vacy Act of 1974, for a school district to re-
lease student directory information.
The school district also provided us bound-
ary files for neighborhood school attendance
zones. We geocoded students' addresses and
then used Atlas GIS to assign geocoded ad-
dresses to corresponding school attendance
boundaries.
Then we were able to measure how many
students were leaving their neighborhood
school zones to go to choice schools. But we
also wanted to know something about the eco-
nomic status of those leaving and those staying.

Economic status
We first tried to link student addresses to
county property tax data, intending to use
property values as proxy measures of student
economic status. We discovered problems
with this approach, though. We felt that we
would have to develop separate measurement
scales for those who lived in rental property
and those who lived in their own homes.
However, the tax rolls didn't identify rental
properties or provide rent cost data.
We abandoned this approach, swallowed
hard, and turned to our marketing depart-
ment for a piece from its collection of
Claritas data: estimated 1999 median house-
hold income and 1990 educational attain-
ment by census block group. (See the Jan./
Feb. 2000 issue of Uplink for a more detailed

discussion on measuring student economic
status).
We used Atlas GIS to assign each student's
address to the census block group within which
it fell. Then, we linked the student address data
to the Claritas income and education data, join-
ing on the block group field.
Block group-level income and education
data served as rough indicators of individual
students' socioeconomic status. This method
allowed us to make observations based on the
socioeconomic status of the block groups in
which students lived, but not on individual
students.
We used SPSS to calculate income quartiles
for all middle and high school students, based
on the block group in which they lived.
We assigned an income quartile ranking to
each student in the data set. Then, we used
FoxPro to create three tables:
1.) One grouping the data by middle
school/high school income quartile within each
school.
2.) One grouping by middle school/high
school income quartile within each attendance
zone.
3.) One grouping by income quartile
among students living in each attendance zone
but enrolling in a choice school.
We joined the three tables on school name.
The result was a table that contrasted the num-
ber of students in each quartile living within a
school attendance zone with the number of
students actually attending the school and the
number going to choice schools.
Opening the table into Excel, we calculated
percentage of each school's enrollment, atten-
dance zone and choice school out-migration
falling into each quartile.
We found that in 11 of Oklahoma City's
13 neighborhood middle and high school at-
tendance zones, a disproportionately low num-
ber of students from the lowest income quartile,
and disproportionately high number of stu-
dents from the highest income quartile, had
left neighborhood schools for choice schools.
School lunch data reinforced this observa-
tion. We found that the opposite was happen-
ing in neighborhood schools.

Other measures
Virtually all of the income disproportionality

between neighborhood schools and their at-
tendance zones was attributable to the out-mi-
gration of students to choice schools. A tiny
portion was attributable to out-migration to
other neighborhood schools.
However, we were unable with our data to
measure how many students were leaving
neighborhood school attendance zones for sub-
urban schools and private schools. While we
weren't able to distinguish between students
recaptured from private schools and suburban
public schools, we were able to identify those
students enrolling in Oklahoma City schools
from addresses outside the district. (A dispro-
portionate number of high-income students
from out of district were getting into choice
schools.)
We used similar methods to analyze house-
hold education levels within neighborhood
schools' attendance zones, and to contrast them
with the household education levels of the
block groups in which out-migrating students
lived.
To get an idea of racial proportionality, we
compared the racial makeup of each choice
school with the racial makeup of the nearest
neighborhood school serving the same grades.
In virtually every instance, we found that the
choice schools, while having diverse popula-
tions, had disproportionately more white stu-
dents.
We also analyzed district admission statis-
tics and found that a greater percentage of
minority applicants than of white applicants
were being denied admission to those choice
schools that used selective admission criteria.
These measurements provided a framework
on which Bobby hung anecdotal evidence gath-
ered through countless hours spent inside
choice schools and neighborhood schools, and
through innumerable interviews and focus-
group sessions.
Did we prove that neighborhood-school
students are being harmed by the choice school
system?
No. But we did create a replicable set of
measurements against which to discuss stud-
ies showing that students in schools with greater
concentrations of poverty tend to perform
more poorly on standardized tests.

the newly vacant space in the community
program with another inmate from one of
Connecticut's overcrowded prisons.
By the time we wrote the story, nearly
15 percent of Connecticut's entire inmate
population was listed as escaped.
Peeler was the perfect example of how
the system had broken down. He simply
turned his back and walked out the front
door after arguing with counselors at his
halfway house over a couple of broken
light bulbs. His contract stipulated that
he was only allowed off the premises for
four hours at a time to look for work.
The police were called, an escape war-

done to find Peeler until 10 months later
when BJ and his mother were gunned
down before BJ could testify that he saw
Russell Peeler - Adrian's older brother -

provided on the CD.
All of the vanished prisoners had one of
three location codes in the master file that didn't
appear in our lookup table. When we called
to find out what the missing codes meant, a
prison official sheepishly told us they were "es-
cape," "abscond," and "inadvertent release."
That's when we knew Peeler's was not an iso-
lated case.
Another field in the database, "deadtime,"
contained the number of days not credited
towards a prisoner's sentence because he had
taken an unscheduled and unannounced leave
of absence from the Department of Correc-
tion.
Not only did the "deadtime" field help us
write the story of a man appropriately named
Ricky Void, who spent 10 long years on the
lam from the DOC. It also helped us show
that almost nobody is ever arrested for escape
alone.
Among the deadtimers were escapees re-
arrested for murder, rape, robbery, assault, al-
most everything but escape. That's how we

realized that very little is ever done to hunt
down an escapee.
Another file in the database, the "move-
ment" file, proved the most useful. The move-
ment file showed the path of each inmate
through the Department of Correction.

Findings
We found 800 inmates since 1994 who had
escaped more than once. Typically, they were
sent to a halfway house, escaped, re-arrested
on new charges, put back in prison, sent again
to a halfway house or home release, escaped
again, re-arrested yet again on still more new
charges and sent back to prison.
It turned out that there is almost no pun-
ishment for escaping once, or even twice, from
a low-security community program. The DOC
policy states that the prisoner must wait 120
days after re-capture before he can be released
again.
Hundreds of pages of paper files, and
months of interviews with wardens, escaped
prisoners, and crime victims fleshed out what
the data seemed to tell us.
Since our series ran, the legislative leader-
ship has called for sweeping change in the com-
munity corrections programs. The Commis-
sioner of the DOC has beefed up the who is
responsible for bringing back escapees, and a
Web site with names and photos of escapes
has been proposed.

Second look
Conneticut calls itself "The Land of Steady
Habits," and this tale of the flawed supervised
release program backs up that claim.
In 1992, The Hartford Courant did a simi-
lar story using the same prison data. What did
the newspaper find? That more than 1,000
convicts in the supervised home release pro-
gram had "escaped," and some of them had
committed serious crimes after "escaping."
This is just one more example of why it
never hurts to revisit a subject a few years later
and follow up after the first expose - a tactic
we don't do enough.

Census Workshops
A third date for the IRE and NICAR Census 2000 semi-
nars has been set for Dec. 8-10 in College Park, Md.
Others will be held April 7-9 in Tempe, Ariz., and Aug
4-6 in Columbia, Mo.
These intensive two-day sessions will be a fast-track les-
son on what you need to know to start producing stories
when the data begins to emerge at the end of this year.
Instructors will be Paul Overberg, a database editor at
USA Today, and Steve Doig, the former Miami Herald re-
search editor who now teaches computer-assisted report-
ing at Arizona State University.
More information, including registration forms and a
schedule, is available at www.ire.org/training/
censusworkshoptempe.html
Also check out Doig's new Web site on using data from
the 2000 Census. The site is at http://cronkite.pp.asu.edu/
census (note: make sure "frames" are enabled on your

The project, supported by a grant from the Russell Sage
Foundation, features a variety of pages that will be useful
for journalists.
