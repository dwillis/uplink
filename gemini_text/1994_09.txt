Computers help expose crime, poverty
CAR uncovers urban ills
By Andy Hall
Wisconsin State Journal (Madison)
On Oct. 11, 1992, the Wisconsin State Journal published a disturbing front-page headline: "Crisis hits home front. Creeping urban ills threaten our special city." We came up with an upbeat title, though, for the new series — "City of Hope."
Nearly two years later, the "City of Hope" logo continues to accompany our reports examining Madison's urban problems. And while reporters have rotated in and out of the project, one member of the reporting team — our newsroom's personal computer — has played an increasingly valuable role.
This project is an excellent example of how computers can become an important, inexpensive and innovative tool. Our newspaper, after all, had only one PC (a Zeos 386 purchased in 1991 for less than $2,000). Software costs (Excel spreadsheet, FoxPro for database analysis, SPSS for statistical analysis) have totaled about $1,000. Data costs are low — about $350 for Madison police records, $150 for census on CD-ROM. A decent CD-ROM reader costs about $350.
None of our reporters was trained in computing. We learned while doing the project. (That was a mistake. Get some decent training up front. It saves time and frustration). And we shamelessly scrounged for free help from in-house and university experts, as well as journalists who have tackled other computer-assisted reporting projects.

First, a summary of what we've done. In ten major packages, we've outlined the problems — and potential solutions — regarding juvenile crime, racism, the safety net, repeat offenders, a neglected neighborhood that became violent, crime patterns, links between crime and socioeconomic factors, a shortage of jobs that pay livable wages, and a lack of low-cost housing. We've tried to show how the problems, and their solutions, are connected to one another.
Our project is an unusual blend of traditional investigative reporting methods, lengthy periods spent out in the community in residents' homes, and computer-assisted journalism. In addition, before we published most packages, we convened a group of community leaders and experts on that topic to discuss solutions to the problems. This helped cause residents and, frankly, our editors, to buy into the project.
Findings and techniques include:
— Quality threatened: (Oct. 11, 1992) A dramatic increase in violent crime and poverty raises concerns

Investigative journalists opt for CAR day
Tapes for those who missed it
By Rosemary Armao
IRE Executive Director
We gotta change the name. For years
the little-something-extra program
staged before the traditional Friday start of IRE's national conference has
been referred to as the Optional Day. But the
fare of that program changed two conferences
ago from such traditional staples as ethics, libel
and writing to computer-assisted reporting,
and ever since, the Optional Day has been
more like Mandatory Day.
Hands-on training classes were filled and
closed nearly as soon as the sign-up sheets
were hung in New York City in 1993. And in
St. Louis this June a record crowd of 450
crammed an Optional Day devoted to computer skills and on-line resources.
IRE/NICAR's low prices ($35 for a full-
day computing seminar at St. Louis) were part
of the draw, but no more so than the array of
talent and topics. We've begun debating
whether it's not time to start integrating CAR
panels into the traditional conference program.
That would be consistent with our philosophy
that while CAR is the new, hot technique
among journalists, it is, in the end, not much
different than conquering the telephone or the
VDT in order to produce better journalism.
Still, the numbers persuade us there's a
special demand to focus on CAR training.
If you didn't make it to St. Louis, we invite
you to look over what you missed and catch up.
For little more than the cost of copying and
mailing, you may order handouts from any of
the Optional Day panels. Copies of "Computer Assisted Research: A Guide to Tapping
Online Information" by Nora Paul are on sale
for $3 plus shipping and handling.
And audiotapes of the sessions are available
for $8 each by ordering directly from Sound
Images Inc., P.O. Box 460519, Aurora, CO
80046.
Also available are tapes of all the sessions
from IRE's first computer-training boot camp,
a three-day, mind-wringing immersion in CAR
last fall at Raleigh.
To be honest, tape sales of the computer-
assisted sessions don't sell as well as those from
other advanced-reporting panels. We suspect
there's a fear that audio without the attendant
visual component of screens and demos don't
work.

They do. Ask for reviews of the tapes you're
interested in from IRE/NICAR staffers who
listen to nothing else while driving around Columbia and off on summer vacations.

CAR uncovers
urban ills
Madison could lose its high quality of life
— and its national reputation as a great place
to live. We used interviews and a took a very
basic look at crime and demographic data.
- Juvenile crime skyrockets: (Nov. 8-11,
1992) The juvenile justice system is a revolving door for hard-core offenders, with troubled
teens bouncing from one program to another
while their crimes multiply. This time we used
interviews and a manual review of court
records.
- Racism widespread: (Dec. 20, 1992)
Blacks suffer from frequent racism despite the
city's liberal image and widespread residential
integration. We conducted a public-opinion
survey designed, conducted, and analyzed by
reporters and in-house polling workers, with
advice from university experts. An in-house
marketing director with expertise in SPSS, a
statistical analysis program, helped us analyze
the findings.
- Fixing fragmented system: (April 18-
27, 1993) Local leaders are trying to transform a human services system as fragmented
and troubled as the community it serves.
- Repeaters spur crime: (June 20, 1993)
Repeat criminals contribute to dramatic increases in crime here. People charged with
committing more than one crime accounted
for nearly 85 percent of criminal charges from
1988 to 1992. We used a computer to analyze
data obtained from county court officials. A
computer expert who runs our company's
billing and subscriber operations helped us
transfer the data from a 9-track tape into the
newsroom PC. (He has a tape reader, worth
$15,000, so the newsroom didn't need to purchase one.)
- Worthington's pain: (Sept. 26-27, 1993)
Three decades of neglect by apartment owners and city officials left the Worthington Park
neighborhood on Madison's near East side
vulnerable to crime and decay. Increased police patrols in other city neighborhoods pushed
drug dealers into Worthington. We spent time
in the neighborhood to witness problems and
become acquainted with the residents and
police, manually tallied microfiche building-inspection reports and used FoxPro to compile
census and police data for the neighborhood
The police department, at our request, compiled an analysis of its data, too. The census data
was on a $150 compact disc of Summary Tape
File 3A (commonly called STF 3A) that has
proven its value many times over.
- Crime concentrated: (Feb. 20-22, 1994)
While violence in Madison stabilized last year,
most serious crime continues to be concentrated in several neighborhoods. Using help
from an in-house computer expert, we transferred 1992 and 1993 police data from 9-track
tapes to our PC. We analyzed calls for service
— not just incidents officially designated as
crimes — because they give a richer portrait of
neighborhood strife. We focused on 10 types of
violent incidents. Intensive time spent in the
city's most violent neighborhood brought the
story to life and spurred ideas, too, for the data
analysis. We compared demographics to violence patterns.
- Unemployment, crime linked: (March
20-21, 1994) A natural follow-up to the previous package. An analysis of police and U.S.
Census data shows that the areas of highest
unemployment, large numbers of idle youths,
and highest numbers of blacks are the areas
with highest violence. Findings suggest
policymakers might focus on better jobs and
education to lower violence in the community.
Poverty experts from the University of Wisconsin helped us use our crime and census data
in a regression analysis — A method researchers commonly rely on to explain social factors.
We paired this story with an in-depth comparison of two families, one poor and one well off.
We also used PUMS — the census' Public Use
Microdata Sample — to get a closer look at
who's poor.
- Job market faulty: (March 27, 1994)
Underlying problems in the Dane County job
market are pushing poor residents into a swelling number of low-paying, dead-end jobs. Interviews, census data, and employment data
told most of the story. But a simple half-day
exercise — typing job-training and pay data for
the fastest-growing jobs into FoxPro — gave
the analysis some real bite: "An analysis of
Dane County's 40 fastest-growing occupations
reveals that most newly created jobs won't pay
enough for poor families to climb out of poverty."
- Shortage of low-cost housing: (May 1-2,
1994) Affordable housing is largely segregated

and confined to certain urban neighborhoods in
Madison, while fast-growing suburbs have little
affordable housing. And the gap is expanding.
We used FoxPro and census data to determine
how many housing units in each Dane County
community were within reach of poor households. Housing experts, who'd long wished for
such an analysis, helped us decide precisely
what to look for. Graphics and maps played a
key role in making housing and crime packages
understandable. We also used the Comprehensive Housing Affordability study, which is free
from HUD. The study is also available on CD.
The results are pouring in. Police patrols
have been moved and a neighborhood center is
being opened in Worthington Park. The police
now refer some public inquiries about crime to
the State Journal. A "jobs summit" is being held
this summer to find ways to improve the local labor market. A county task force has been
formed to increase the supply of low-cost
housing.
We've begun incorporating the lessons of
"City of Hope" into our daily beat reporting.
Reporters are asking developers about the
affordability of new housing projects, and
they're finding out whether new jobs pay
livable wages.
And in the newsroom, we're replacing our
mid-1970s Harris mainframe with a PC-based
system, meaning every reporter will have a
486 computer. We are committed to using
these powerful machines not just for writing
stories, but for finding the real stories hidden
between the numbers.

Would-be cyberjournalists beware!
Internet robust but unreliable
By Gwen Carleton
NICAR Staff
Despite the recent fascination with the Internet,
there is a reason that much of the world is hanging on to
its telephones and fax machines. In fact, there are
several.
For journalists, one of the net's worst failings is its
lack of verifiability.
"In USENET newsgroups, there's a barrage of inaccurate stuff posted all the time," said Dan Gillmor, a
reporter for the San Jose Mercury News. "People put up
opinions, and people forge opinions from someone else."
Much of the "official" information flowing through
Internet must be double-checked as well. The federal
government takes no responsibility for mistakes that are
transmitted through FedWorld, for example.
Researchers see similar weaknesses in the system.
Gopher, a popular application that organizes access to
Internet resources, helps information seekers to pursue
specific topics throughout the vast network.
"To me, the problem with Gopher is, you don't know
what it's indexing on," said Nora Paul, library director
for the Poynter Institute. "You type in a word, but what
has it searched? There's so much reliance on someone
being reliable somewhere."
Another serious obstacle for journalists is the fluid
nature of the network itself.
"I have been at budget meetings and promised to
obtain information I knew was available on the net, only to get back to the office and find that for some reason or
other the information was unavailable at the time," said
Michael Meiners, database specialist for the Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel.
Internet vagaries, from disappearing databases to
access overloads, are all part of the experience. But
according to Beth Marchak, a reporter for the Cleveland Plain Dealer, that's no excuse for staying unplugged.
"You don't wait until 4 in the afternoon to put out a
PROFNET request," she said. "You do it first thing in
the morning."
Programs such as jughead, veronica, gopher and
mosaic have been developed to make the organization
and retrieval of information on the Internet simpler.
Even so, users agree that Internet adventurers must
know what they're looking for. As Marchak pointed
out, "there is no one-stop shopping." The network is no
substitute for reporting.
"It doesn't replace anything else; it's a supplement,"
Gillmor said. "You still have to get out of the office."
However, for all its quirks and limitations, the Internet
is a resource to watch. And it rewards those who learn
to use it well.
"The Internet offers many possibilities, several successes and thousands of disappointments," Meiners
said. "I think it has a long way to go before it is a reliable
resource for directed research, but I still seem to end up
using it at least once a day.”

Drive-by shootings in Tacoma
By Adam Berliant
Tacoma News Tribune
Guns, gangs and drive-by shootings.
For obvious and unfortunate reasons, violence, the media buzz-word of the '90s, quickly
brings these thoughts to mind. But few would
deny that among them, there's something particularly disturbing about drive-by shootings.
You can choose not to own a gun. You can
choose not to belong to a gang. But drive-by
shootings seem beyond our control. Even worse,
we're hearing increasingly how innocent people
end up stopping the bullets.
Yetlast year, when The News Tribune ran its
eight-day series on crime, "Beyond Violence,"
Tacoma and Pierce County police could barely
provide us with even the vaguest clue about how
many drive-by shootings there were in our city,
much less how likely it was for bystanders to
actually get shot.
The "Beyond Violence" project was time-consuming, titanic in scope and extremely thorough (see Uplink, Sept. 1993). The series was
made possible by a police database containing
seven years' worth of violent crime incident
reports, about 250,000 records. We proudly
squeezed that data until there was nothing left.
That's why it was so bothersome that we
couldn't get real numbers for drive-by shootings.
The Law Enforcement Support Agency (LESA),
the record-keeping mechanism for both the city
and county police that provided The News Tribune with the database, simply didn't bother to
categorize drive-by shootings separately. Instead,
drive-bys were recorded as assault, vandalism or
reckless endangerment.
So, we were stuck with anecdotes.
One police official told us there were so many
drive-by shootings in Tacoma that people didn't
even bother to report them anymore. Patrol
officers guessed that there were as many as four
drive-by shootings every night, a shocking figure for any city, but even more so in a town the
size of Tacoma.
The stories and numbers seemed hard to
believe, and we were disappointed (to put it
nicely) that better information about drive-bys
wasn't available.
Fortunately, the feeling was mutual — police
were just as eager to track drive-bys as we were.
Only a few months before the violence project
was published, LESA started tracking drive-bys. By the time the violence project's one year anniversary arrived, the 16-month-old drive-by
database was ripe for analysis.
The News Tribune obtained the drive-by
data and also bought an update of the original
violent crime database. The total cost was around.
$200, and the data was supplied in compressed
files on four diskettes. (The original, seven-year
database came on VAX cartridges.)
After spending about a week updating the
findings from the previous year, we discarded
our original idea to produce a large, follow-up
violence project. There simply wasn't much new
information we could derive from one year's
data that seven years' worth hadn't already
made clear last summer. It was hard to get
excited about publishing a dozen "Fill-in-the-blank: One Year Later" stories when they could
probably all read "ditto."
Instead, we used the data to prove, once
again, that database reporting can lead to excellent, relatively short enterprise stories.
We started by determining once and for all
that there weren't three or four drive-by
shootings every night in Tacoma. The database
showed there were 200 incidents over a full year
— about one every other night.

The drive-by stories
were XDB's dying
gasp here at the
News Tribune. I've
always liked XDB
even if it was slow,
but when I found out
the absurd price for
upgrades and
additional licenses,
and when I finally
persuaded my
editors to let me
experiment with
FoxPro for a few
days, I put good ol'
XDB to sleep. Now
I'm desperately
trying to master
FoxPro in time for
Access to take over
the market.
May the wheels of
progress continue to
smash us flat!

More interesting for our readers, though,
was that drive-bys weren't the random acts of
violence they were perceived to be, and that
drive-bys presented little threat to most people.
The data proved this in three ways.
First, it showed that strangers in strange
places were not of much interest to drive-by
shooters. The targets of 1 in 3 drive-bys were
houses that had been targeted previously. And
if the target wasn't one of these "hot houses,"
then it was the house next door, or some other
house on the block.
In other words, the records showed that the
majority of drive-bys occurred on certain streets,
in particular parts of town. And, police told us,
these parts coincided exactly with the areas of
greatest known gang and drug activity.
The conclusion made by both police and The
News Tribune was that if you weren't in a gang,
involved with drugs or living next door to someone who was, you didn't have much to worry
about.
Second, the data suggested that drive-by
shootings were not increasing, as many people
feared. Although we didn't have enough data to
report with complete certainty that there was no
trend, a month-to-month analysis of what data
we did have showed that '94, so far, wasn't any worse than last year.
Finally, the police records indicated that a
large portion of drive-by shootings didn't target
people at all. We provided a break-out box
showing how many of the drive-bys were categorized secondarily as assaults, homicides,
reckless endangerment, etc. It showed that 30
percent of all drive-bys were determined by
police to be acts of vandalism (40 percent outside city limits).
Police sources had a different story than
they did a year earlier. Officials were now
saying the odds of getting shot by a drive-by
were less than being struck by lightning. One
police source called the public "paranoid about
getting shot by gang members."
It took only a few hours to complete all the
reports necessary to reach these conclusions.
Patti Epler, who wrote two stories using the
drive-by data, completed her reporting in less
than two weeks.
We were also able to use the data to include
a standard database answer dump: where are
the worst parts of town for drive-bys, what's the
worst season for drive-bys and what time do the
shootings take place.

Japanese equipment prices rising
Alan Warzecha of Computer Logics called to warn
CAR journalists that prices for Japanese computer
equipment are on the rise because of the weakness of the
dollar.
Warzecha said Fujitsu has raised prices $600 on low-
end tape cart readers to about $9,400. He also noted that
9-Track drives are American made and therefore should
not be directly affected.

NICAR and IRE hit the Net with two new lists
IRE, NICAR and the University of Missouri have
launched two new lists aimed at investigative reporters
and journalists who use computers for newsgathering
and analysis. NICAR-L and IRE-L aim to provide a
discussion forum for journalists and educators interested in investigative and computer-assisted reporting.
To subscribe to NICAR-L, send an e-mail message to
"listserv@mizzoul.missouri.edu" and include the words
"SUBSCRIBE NICAR-Lyour name" providing the first
and last name your would like to use on the list. To
subscribe to the IRE list, simply substitute "IRE-L" for
"NICAR-L" on the message line.

Gillmor goes West
Dan Gillmor, Internet surfer extraordinaire, has packed
his bags and moved to the San Jose Mercury News where
he will serve as technology editor.
He is also helping to put together Internet training at
the CAR TREK conference October 6-9.

Jobs, jobs, jobs
Speaking of job switches, NICAR is getting more and
more requests from news organizations looking for CAR
reporters and editors.
If you want your name quietly suggested as a possibility, give Brant Houston a call at (314) 882-1984. We hope
to put together a job bank later this year.

The CAR lot: Charlotte, North Carolina
Paper marks decade of CAR
By Ted Mellnick
The Charlotte Observer
The Charlotte Observer was an early pioneer in computer-assisted journalism. Back in
1984, the newspaper used an IBM mainframe
to catalog political contributions to 267 candidates for the North Carolina legislature.
The stories showed the raw power of special
interest money ($2 of every $3 contributed),
and the links between gifts and lawmakers'
votes on issues like recycling, pollution control
and business fees.
That project, which has continued and expanded for a decade, also shows how the
newsroom's use of computers has gotten bigger, more sophisticated and more self-sufficient.
Back in '84, a computer programmer developed the mainframe applications, and a market
research analyst handled printed reports, queries and analysis. Now, the project has moved
from a mainframe to a newsroom PC.
Instead of a couple thousand, there are tens
of thousands of contributors on file. And one
newsroom staffer has handled programming,
application development and report design.
Besides state and federal campaign finance,
computer-related stories have reported: Inequities in property taxes, disparities in mortgage
lending, and differences in OSHA inspection
rates and workers compensation injury rates.
We've used Census data to look at growth
trends, poverty patterns and racial disparity in
education and income.
My two favorite census stories were based
on the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS)
file. The analysis was done in the statistical
package SAS, running in UNIX on an HP9000.
One story involved a comparison of earnings of men, childless women and mothers in
the Carolinas. It showed that women make less,
even when compared with men of the same age,
education, or, in most
cases, the same job.
The other was a
study of commuters.
It revealed that inbound commuters
play a much larger
than expected role in
Charlotte's
workforce, constituting 40 percent of the city's full-time workers.
The published census estimate, which included
part-time workers, was 30 percent. The story
also showed the income benefits various kinds
of workers derive from their longer drive time
into the city.
"Criminals in the Classroom," a series published in March, began with The Observer
matching a file of 50,000 teachers against a file
of 300,000 prison inmates. The state doesn't
require background checks for public school
teachers. Matching revealed that people convicted of rape, incest, child molesting and assault still teaching.
Our current projection on neighborhood
crime involves plotting, by address, 18,000
violent crimes reported to Charlotte police in
1992-93.
The computer base map of street blocks was
derived from data compiled by local government and university staffers in the GIS package ARC/INFO. The newspaper did the address matching in Atlas GIS/DOS.
The resulting reports and maps plotted on a
CalComp 8-pen plotter gave our reporters their
first definitive view of the city's high crime
areas, their first rankings of neighborhood violent crime rates and their first detailed maps of
the exact locations of violent crimes. This material has been the starting point for a year-long
series of neighborhood profiles.
The computer side of the crime project also
has included plotting more than 12,000 home
break-ins and estimating neighborhood break-in rates, plotting the home addresses of thousands of victims and profiling suspects and
victims.
Now that our newsroom has developed a
few basic computer-assisted reporting skills,
the goal is to spread those skills among the staff.
There are now four PCs on the newsroom
floor — up from one a year ago — loaded with
database, spreadsheet
and communications
programs. Last May,
eight newsroom staffers went through
three days of in-house
training on FoxPro.
More training is
planned.
