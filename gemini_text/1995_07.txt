Uplink update

Covering campaign contribu-
tions is a staple of computer-as-
sisted reporting. But it's tricky.

A lot of states do not offer com-
puterized donation databases. The
Federal Election Commission's on-
line service is not perfect. And there
is always the need to go beyond the
numbers for hard-hitting stories.
This issue helps you with these prob-
lems.

Two Associated Press reporters
tell how they computerized state
election records available only on
papėr. One used scanners. The other
arranged a massive data entry team.
Both got good stories. Padraic
Cassidy of the Los Angeles Times
(and a former NICAR staff mem-
ber) tells how to use the FEC on-line
database.

Christopher Schmitt of the San
Jose Mercury News and Jackie
Duobinis from the National Library
on Money & Politics offer tips on
analyzing contribution records.

And the Poynter Institute's Nora
Paul offers tips on how to use the
Internet to better cover campaigns.

Federal campaign reports that don't add up

Giving and getting

By Padraic Cassidy
Los Angeles Times

From the campaign treasurer to your
computer's hard drive, data from the
Federal Election Commission follows a
tortured route.

The paper records are filed first with
the Clerk of the House or the Senate,
who photocopies them and send them to
the FEC on microfilm. The FEC then
makes paper copies from the microfilm,
keeps a copy for public view and sends
a copy out to be keypunched. That data
then is checked and made available to
the Direct Access Program users.

The good news is that the FEC makes
a mammoth effort to have data on thou-
sands of committees available as soon as
possible after the reporting period dead-
lines. The bad news is that the smallest
keypunch errors can wreak havoc on a
news story.

Check, please

Recently a problem cropped up in the
amounts each candidate was suppos-
edly contributing to their own campaign:
For a while, the records showed Senate
hopeful Michael Huffington giving his
campaign $2 million more than he actu-
ally did, although that may have been
hard to see in a campaign where he
chipped in $28 million of his own money.

But take the case of Kyle McSlarrow
in his losing campaign for Virginia's 8th
district. Just two keypunch errors ac-
counted for a $3 million mistake in a
campaign where he spent less than
$700,000. The FEC is working to cor-
rect the errors and the best advice is to
sum all figures and check, check, check
those totals.

The majority of the useful informa-
tion - and the type most easily acces-
sible for stories on deadline - hangs out
in two major areas: The "5" report sec-
tion for PACs, party committees and
other committees, and the "1" report
section for individual donors. The FEC
supplies totals for almost every search.

Best votes money can buy?

Paying UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI COLUMBIA the bills

By Christopher H. Schmitt
San Jose Mercury News

It's the ultimate question when
journalists focus on campaign cash
and elected officials' behavior: Can
you prove that the money directly
influences votes on particular bills?

Ultimately, no, unless officials are
caught asking for money in exchange
for votes. But short of that, we re-
cently used a regression analysis to
show campaign contributions are of-
ten a strong predictor not only of
aggregate behavior, but of individual
votes on individual bills.

The analysis, which focused on
10 major bills from California's 1993-
94 legislative session, showed that
the more money individual lawmak-
ers took from interests pushing a par-

Miiking campaign funds

Scan for the facts

By Rich Eggleston
Associated Press

The Associated Press bureau in Wisconsin
showed that the lack of an electronic database is
no obstacle to good computer-assisted report-
ing.

The bureau wanted to track campaign
fundraising by Gov. Tommy Thompson and
other state politicians. Wisconsin, like some
other states, does not store data electronically, it
only requires candidates to file on paper. The
longer reports — like Thompson's — almost
defy manual analysis.

Our solution: a scanner.

We took the step last year, after Nick Schiavo,
a former Air Force computer expert, asked how
a computer could solve problems with govern-
ment records. I told him about campaign re-
ports, and how few news organizations spend
the time or money inputting the information.

Schiavo believes the latest scanning technol-
ogy is faster and more accurate than punching it
in. He wrote a program to accommodate the
state forms. He customized optical character
recognition and data entry systems. Microsoft
and Microrim R:BASE software runs the pro-
grams. He scanned in the first reports using
DataPen, a hand-held scanner, but later ones
were scanned in more efficiently with a sheet-
fed scanned. He dumped the information into
FoxPro. The endeavor went so well that Schiavo
created his own small company,
Campaign Watch, which sells the package.

Each computerized record included the page
number from the paper report. We traced back
anything that looked funny. The scanner did
turn one $1,200 contribution into a $120,000
contribution, but we used the page number to
catch the error. There were typos, but the prod-
uct was remarkably accurate. When one male
contributor was listed in the database as a house-
wife, we went back to the paper records and
found nothing wrong — the campaign listed
him that way.

Our bureau produced stories on business
executives backing the incumbent, and a chal-
lenger relying on support from one county. We
also examined cross-giving to both candidates.

I found contributions timed with a special
legislative session that loosened state telecom-
munications regulation, and noted how accoun-
tants and builders said "Thank You" with their
checkbooks for laws that benefited their profes-
sions.

Schiavo plans to upgrade his package as
optical scanning equipment improves. Some
fonts are too difficult to scan in, and handwritten
documents are still too tough. He is also starting
to cross-reference the state contribution data
with Federal Election Commission records.

As our governor pushes legislation for the
next four years, I'll keep checking his moves
against the list of political I.O.U.'s in my hard
drive.

How to check campaign coffers

By Jackie Duobinis
The National Library on Money & Politics

Here are some tips to remember when you
examine campaign contributions.

• Check campaign records for patterns. Sort
contributions chronologically to spot fundraising
events and bundling. Sort by employer to also
check for contribution bundling. Sort by last
names to find family members and multiple
contributions from an individual.

• As always, stop and ask why? Why are there
50 contributions on the same day? Why did
every executive from Jones & Johnson give?
Look for people at corporations who would not
normally be giving, like secretaries and assis-
tants. Were they reimbursed or pressured?

• Look for coincidences. Does the candidate
own stock in a corporation whose PAC is con-
tributing? Is there a bill sponsored by that legis-
lator that affects the individual or corporation?

• Take a look at the paper trail. Even though
looking at computerized campaign finance
records is important, some things aren't com-
puterized. Check the disbursements on Sched-
ule B. Track payments to consultants and com-
panies. Check for loans on Schedule C. Look at
the detail of debt on Schedule D.

• Remember this is only a start. The contribu-
tions or expenditures point you in the right
direction. Rarely are they the whole story.

The New Yorker
probed how media
and
telecommunication
conglomerates, using
campaign
contributions and
lobbying efforts, are
trying to sway
Congress on federal
communication and
tax laws. The June 5
story by Ken Auletta,
called "Pay Per
Views," examined
cross-giving and other
patterns as executives
seek to sway policy.

The Center for
Responsive Politics
plans to launch an
Internet site this
month. The address
will be gopher.crp.org.
The center also plans
to make data available

Tracking pirates

A speedboat with armed bandits chased down a cargo
ship in the South China Sea. Masked bandits stole from a
container ship anchored off Rio de Janeiro. These inci-
dents are part of the rise in piracy, according to the Journal
of Commerce. Reporter Michael Fabey used a government
electronic bulletin board service (BBS), Marlinespike, to
help report the April 8 story.

The BBS is (202) 366-8505, with settings 8-1-N. The
section to check is the ONI World Wide Threat to Ship-
ping.

Check out transplant rates

Using data from the United Network for Organ Sharing,
Hartford Courant reporter Robert S. Capers charted the
survival rates of organ transplant patients at hospitals
across the country and in the newspaper's backyard.

The bulletin board information is easily downloaded
and analyzed with spreadsheet or database software, and
can be tailored for any audience in the country.

The UNOS data includes patient survival rates at four
time intervals for six procedures at every U.S. transplant
center over a three-year period. It also contains demo-
graphics on donors and recipients and comments from
transplant center officials.

To find the UNOS organ transplant data, dial into the
HHS bulletin board at (301) 443-5913. Enter your name
and address when prompted and you will be added to the
department's database for future logons.

Choose the file menu, then the download option. The
file is survival.zip. For those who don't have it, decom-
pression software is also there. UNOS also runs a World
Wide Web site with numerous facts and statistics on organ
transplants. Visit http://www.infi.net/~shreorg/unos.html

Commerce changes on-line data site

The U.S. Commerce Department consolidated its vast
STAT-USA Internet sites June 15. That means the STAT-
USA gopher and ftp servers are being shut down. The
agency now charges a subscriber fee of $24.95 for three
months, or $100 for a year, for access through its web site.

STAT-USA includes more than 300,000 government
reports, including the federal government's budget, the
president's economic report, regional and national eco-
nomic data, and foreign trade reports. The sources include
U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the National Trade
Data Bank.

Among the more useful sections is the Economic Bul-
letin Board, which offers reports "just minutes after its
official release" from the Federal Reserve Board, the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Treasury Department and
other federal agencies.

For more information or to subscribe, go to www.stat-
usa.gov, or call STAT-USA at (202) 482-1986.
