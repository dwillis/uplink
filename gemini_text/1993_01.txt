Optical character reader turns
analysis into 4-month nightmare

BY BARB PEARSON
USA Today

A look at how Congress spends its
money was USA Today's first experience
with scanning. Perhaps it was the size of the
project (7,500 pages) or the number of
records (325,000) or the complexity of the
subject—whatever, it turned out to be a
nightmare.

USA Today and Gannett News Service
wanted to look at what it costs to run
Congress and to identify, among other
things, the top spenders.
We started by asking
Congressional leaders
for a computer tape of
all 1991 expenses by
House members' offices,
committees and support
departments. They
refused, saying all the
information was publicly
available in four books
kept by the Clerk of the
House. At least one
person acknowledged
that providing the
information on tape,
rather than paper,
would make analysis
easier.

In order to proceed with the project, we
chose to scan the four books into the
computer. The plan was to have the
tabular data scanned and converted into
fixed-position ASCII files, which we could
then read into Paradox.

We quickly dismissed buying a desktop
scanner and doing the work ourselves
because of the volume, and the slowness
and inferiority of portable models. Instead,
we hired a company that estimated scan-
ning on its professional machine would
take four weeks. Try four months.

The company used the Xerox Imaging
Systems K5200, a Kurzweil hardware and
software system priced at $14,500. Stacks of
pages are automatically fed into the
scanner, much like a high-volume copying
machine.

Among our problems:
■ On many pages, the Government
Printing Office had not printed the type
square on the page. The software has a
tolerance of about 5 percent skew, any-
thing more than that requires an operator
to manually place the page in the machine.

This is a very time-consuming process.
The book's agate type stymied the
splitter. The splitter software is designed
to separate touching characters, making it
possible to "read" them. If it splits
improperly, all sorts of strange things can
happen. For example, the letter O could
be read as a C. The splitter has problems
with small and bold text and with charac-
ters that are angled or italic. Well, the
House books are all of that.
■Any stray or unwanted marks on a page.

House Clerk records, actual size. Reading all these numbers
would be daunting to anyone but virtually impossible for an
optical scanning machine.

introduced errors.

The result: Lines of garbled or wrong
characters: 7's appeared as 1's, 8's as 3's.
(Some scanning errors were comical —
shamed employee, instead of shared;
resistant executive, instead of assistant.)
Data from two lines often converged into
one. Plus, the tabular structure of the
original data was often lost, creating
errors later when we imported the fixed
file into Paradox.

It took months of extensive work to
clean up the ASCII files. It was crucial that
every number be double-checked with
the original. And, in order to do any
collapsing of data and analysis, we needed
to correct any errors in staff names, job
titles and government contractors so they
were consistent.

Although it's hard to estimate the
overall error rate caused by scanning, on
some pages more than a fourth of the
characters or numbers were wrong.

Tech tips
Working around a software buy
By ELLIOT JASPIN
Cox Newspapers

Solving some
problems with
delimited files
in XDB

Anyone who has worked with software for
any length of time will soon encounter a
bug. It may be large or small, but once
you hit the enter key and watch a program sail
off into cyberspace, it can be awfully irritating.

My personal favorite involved software for
aircraft navigation. The software worked
perfectly until the plane flew across the equator.
Then the onboard computer commanded the
plane to fly upside down. Hmmmmnn.

While every programmer will try to
produce software with as few bugs as possible,
the chances of producing a perfect piece of
code seems remote. The trick for the user is to
find an acceptable "workaround" when a
problem is encountered.

A particularly irritating bug in some
versions of XDB involves importing delimited
files. Each field in a delimited file is separated
by a character, usually a comma, and text fields
are enclosed within quotation marks. Thus, a
record might appear as:

"Doe, John", "123 Maple St.", "Bristow, VT"

Although there are four commas in our
example, software should be able to see this as a
record with only three fields, because two
commas are within quotation marks. When the
software encounters the first set of quotation
marks, it should know that anything that follows
is data. If it encounters a comma it should not
treat it as a delimiter. Once it reaches the
terminating set of quotation marks, the soft-
ware should consider the comma that follows as
the end of one field and the beginning of
another.

Alas, versions of XDB prior to release 2.41
see the quotation marks but keep on looking
for the comma as a delimiter. The results are
usually commastrophic (ouch).

While the problem is potentially fatal, the
workaround is simple. XDB allows the user to
specify what the field delimiter is when import-
ing a delimited file. By the same token,
NineTrack Express allows the user to pick any
character that can be entered at a keyboard as a
delimiter. Instead of using a comma, transfer a
file in NineTrack Express using a "^" or a "¦",
both characters rarely or ever are found in a
file. Once you have transferred the file from
tape, specify the character in XDB, and the file
should import perfectly.

A few closing notes, this particular
XDB was corrected in version 2.41. But a
similar bug has popped up in the database
program from Microsoft: Access. The software
gets confused when it encounters a record such as:

"Bartowski, "Buddy"", "123 Maple St.",
"Bristow, VT"

As I said at the start, software bugs are
everywhere, like. . .

project carefully consider the quality of your
originals. Is the type clear, preferably not
agate, smudge-free, and printed straight on
pages? Testing is crucial. You should have
several dozen, representative pages scanned
and then doublecheck the electronic data
with the original. How many errors were
introduced and how difficult will correction
be? Is scanning worth it if the cleanup is
extensive?

In researching this article, our contractor
told me that scanning technology has im-
proved dramatically, even since we began our
project a year ago. We hope so. The qua...
the conversion we got was so poor that, h...
we known at the time, we wouldn't have go...
the scanning route. Instead we'd have cut
back on the data we wanted from the House
books and had it double-keved.

Series leaves politicians with no one
to blame for recession but themselves

BY CHRIS FEOLA
The Republican-American
Waterbury, Conn.

Like too much of what happens around here, it
all started when a bureaucrat said something
stupid.

In front of a room packed with businessmen and
journalists, a Connecticut Department of Economic
Development official stood up and laid all the blame
for the state's lingering recession on the shoulders
of the banking industry.

The credit crunch, he said, had taken $2 billion
away from the private sector of Connecticut's
economy. Do you know what that does to an
economy? he asked.

We thought that was a good question, especially
because the government he worked for had taken
just over $2 billion out of the economy in record tax
hikes.

If taking money out of the economy one way was
bad, wouldn't the same hold true for taking it any
other way?

This was not some obscure academic question.
Connecticut was hemorrhaging jobs and wracked by
the recession and defense cutbacks. The state lost
... than 180,000 jobs — almost 12 percent of its
non-farm workforce, which it reached in the
late '80s.

So the question of what had gone wrong with the
economy — and how to fix it — was of vital impor-
tance to our readers, especially since every seat in
the state Legislature, all six spots in the U.S. House
of Representatives, one U.S. Senate seat and the
White House were all up for grabs in the November
election.

We decided to limit our project to the effect taxes
have on the economy. We made that decision for a
couple of reasons: It kept the project manageable,
and taxes are a hot issue in Connecticut. Not only
had the state seen two record tax increases in three
years, but legislators had just passed the state's first
income tax.

So we sat down and made a list. All we needed to
do, we figured, was crunch 10 years of federal
budgets; 10 years of budgets from three states; 10
years of budgets from 22 towns; and 10 years of
budgets from 16 school districts.

Then we needed to find a dozen families,
persuade them to let us look at their finances, then
crunch their budgets to see how much they were
paying in taxes and link it all together with the govern-
ment budgets to show where their money was going.

OK. The project took six months. The Republican-
American has been doing computer-assisted report-
... since 1988, so the resources to handle such big
...sks of data were on hand. The paper has
...eries of 386's with big hard drives, plus a flat-bed
scanner hooked to a very good optical character
recognition program.

We acquired a filing cabinet full of data avail-
able only on paper, and 25 megabytes directly
from government computers via modem. Since
this was primarily a numbers project, we moved
everything into a spreadsheet — Borland's Quattro
Pro for Windows.

We used Quattro to build 3-D spreadsheets with
each topic — the breakout on federal spending,
for example — in a separate sheet that cranked its
results into the master sheet. This kept the master
sheet simple enough to be read by person other
than Werner Von Braun.

"The Tax on Living" ran every day for more
than two weeks, ending the day before the elec-
tion. It showed that the average Connecticut
family was paying a little over 50 percent of their
income in taxes and how those taxes made it
financially attractive for businesses such as UPS to
pay to move their operations to other states.

It showed that 42 percent of the cost of a bottle
of liquor and more than 50 cents on every gallon
of gasoline went for taxes. It showed taxes where
people expected — on gas — and where no one
would have ever guessed — one on gas pump
nozzles and another for pump gauges.

It also showed the money was being spent less
than wisely. Not only did Congress increase its
budget 17 percent last year, the money provided
for things such as the House and Senate photo
studios and radio and television studios.

And then there's overhead. We obtained
government figures that showed more than $300
billion went for overhead — rents, telephone and
utility bills and airfare, among other things. (That's
the total for the entire federal budget, not a
separate appropriation.) That doesn't include a
dime for programs or salaries.

Perhaps the biggest fuss occurred after we
obtained an internal Congressional document that
revealed the ugly truth about the Social Security
Trust Fund: There isn't one.

All Social Security taxes go straight into the
treasury, where they are spent just like the rest of
the taxes. The money is replaced with "IOUs," the
document went on to say.

Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Connecticut, called
the system a sham, a fraud, and said it amounted to
nothing more than flim-flam.

You always wonder if a project like this has any
effect. We know it was read. We were deluged
with calls and letters, and many readers took the
time to fill out and mail us a do-it-yourself total tax
form we printed.

The key to this series was putting families and
faces on the numbers. It is one thing to explain
that X amount of dollars are going out in taxes. It
is another to show photos of the family paying
thousands in taxes and have them explain they
can't afford allergy shots for their child.

"The Tax on
Living"
showed that
the average
Connecticut
family was
paying a
little over 50
percent of
their income
in taxes.

Projects at the San Francisco Examiner and the
Lawrence Eagle-Tribune uncover
(what else?) political waste and greed

Some of our far-flung friends recently wrote
us with details about their computer-
assisted reporting projects.

From Dick Rogers
San Francisco Examiner

It began with a telephone call in February to
Lisa M. Krieger, the Examiner's medical writer.
The caller, a health professional in town,
described what he believed was waste and
incompetence in the use of city, state and
federal funds. The task of evaluating the 100-
plus AIDS programs carried out in San Fran-
cisco was beyond our resources, but it turned
out that the city was about to conduct individual
evaluations of every publicly funded grant
program.

The process took months. It wasn't until
October that we were able to go through each
file folder. There were 124 — each one contain-
ing scores on at least 11 performance catego-
ries, as well as five or more other entries and
written comments. None of it was computer-
ized.

I had been doing some computer-assisted
reporting over the last two years, most of it on
my home PC. In September, the paper ac-
quired a Compaq 486 with a 200-megabyte hard
drive, FoxPro database software and a spread-
sheet. So the AIDS story was my first official
opportunity to demonstrate the number-
crunching virtues of the computer.

Some database wizards won't bother with a
computer story unless the information is
available on disk or tape, but I saw this as a
perfect argument for the build-your-own-
database approach. Besides, it was a way for me
to start getting familiar with FoxPro.

We entered the key information into the
database, adding a few fields for certain calcula-
tions we had in mind. It took about five hours.
Instead of sitting down with a calculator and
two big notebooks worth of numbers to look
for patterns, averages and totals, we let the
computer do the work. The Compaq is a
screamer — the typical sorting process was
completed by the time I looked up from the
keyboard to the screen.

If we sorted incorrectly or failed to include
an important category, it didn't matter. We just
did it again. Compared to the drudgery of
doing all the work by hand, the five hours spent
keying the numbers was time well-spent.

The result was a two-day series built around
our analysis of the city evaluations. The punch
line: San Francisco has created a far-flung
system of AIDS programs that often fall short of
their goals and duplicate efforts, wasting money
that could be used to improve services. The
stories created quite a stir among AIDS groups
and provided us with a follow-up story — a vow by
AIDS officials to straighten out the system.

If it weren't for the computer, we'd still be
fiddling with the calculator and the two big
notebooks of numbers.

From Brad Goldstein and Ed Achorn
The Eagle-Tribune
Lawrence, Mass.

For two years, reporters at The Eagle-Tribune
have been using computers to explore the link
between contributors and political candidates.
Last fall, the computer put us on the trail of
perhaps the biggest story of the campaign in a
local congressional race. A local man, a former
congressman, was running for the 5th district
again, touting his record as a successful business-
man.

When we downloaded his federal election
records and sorted on business, we quickly
discovered some patterns: members of New ...
investment firms and their wives were plowi...
tens of thousands of dollars into his Massachusetts
campaign. One of the contributors was Robert E.
Brennan, who was accused of bilking small
investors of millions of dollars during the 1980s.

Further research disclosed that the individual
investors and their firms had links to Brennan.
Our check with state securities officials revealed
that many of them were under investigation in
several states on securities fraud charges.

A check of reports filed by the candidate's
business ties with the Securities and Exchange
Commission uncovered other interesting side-
lights. Brennan's First Jersey Securities had sold
penny stock in the candidate's's company during
the '80s; a second firm whose members contrib-
uted heavily to his campaign was selling his
company's stock now.

The stock sales helped the company provide a
$700,000 retirement package for the candidate,
although the company had had three years of
losses totaling $2.8 million.

We were able to give readers a broader
perspective on the candidate's career as a self-
made businessman.

The Eagle-Tribune broke the story on the front
page of its Sunday paper. The Boston Herald
followed the next day with information su...ed
by the candidates' opponent.
