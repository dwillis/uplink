REMOTE SENSING
Images
boost
GIS work

By Holly Hacker
IRE and NICAR

Most GIS-savvy journalists are
familiar with shapefiles, points
and polygons. They can place
dots on a map to show crimes
in their neighborhood, or code
Census tracts to identify neigh-
borhoods that gained or lost the
most residents.

But for journalists who use a
geographic information system,
the next spatial frontier to con-
quer is remote sensing, accord-
ing to experts in the business.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch re-
cently discovered the dynamic
stories that can be told by com-
bining satellite images with
other information in a GIS. The
newspaper hired researchers in
Minnesota to study develop-
ment on the Upper Mississippi
River Basin since the flood of
1993. The analysis, which
blended satellite images, Cen-
sus figures and flood area data,
confirmed the lead reporter's
suspicion: Missouri has devel-
oped more flood plain than any

SPOTLIGHT: CITY GOVERNMENT
Data-based approach
reaps great stories

By Michael Mansur, The Kansas City Star

Two years ago, I thought Excel was a
meatpacking plant somewhere in cen-
tral Kansas. I was spreadsheet ignorant.

This was particularly startling because I
had worked on stories with other report-
ers who had analyzed large amounts of
data using Microsoft FoxPro. And years
ago, I had even sorted and analyzed
data in dBASE. But for a variety of rea-
sons, spreadsheets were foreign to me.

Last year I began a new assignment
covering local government. And I al-
most immediately saw the need to

INTRANETS
Newsroom data depots
no longer a luxury

By Matt Carroll, The Boston Globe

In a few short years, searchable data-
bases on newsroom intranets have
gone from novelty to necessity.

Most newsrooms either already have
databases - ranging from state pay-
rolls to police bookings, from licenses
for dogs to licenses for burglar alarms
– or have someone thumbing through
old "Dummies" computer books, learn-
ing how to use them.

Journalists who use the databases
understand their value as a tremen-
dous tool for finding people on dead-
line. With a few keystrokes they can find
the address of the juror who voted to
acquit in the murder trial, the unlisted
phone of an indicted CEO, and all the
campaign contributions from the real
estate industry to the new mayor.

Other papers, such as The New York
Times, have gone the next step and
linked databases together so that jour-
nalists can intuitively follow the flow of

Updated files
The IRE and NICAR Database
Library now has FDA Adverse
Events Reporting System data
spanning 1969 through Decem-
ber 2002 and NASA Air Safety
Reporting data covering 1988
through September 2003.

The FDA database contains
more than 2 million medical
problems associated with phar-
maceutical products reported
by manufacturers, health-care
professionals and consumers.
The database holds information
about each drug's probable role
in a patient's death, disability or
other such event.

In 2000, for example, the Los
Angeles Times found informa-
tion suggesting that the FDA
ignored warnings from its own
scientists and sided with drug
companies chasing profits.

Journalists have used the
NASA data to identify aviation
incidents and gather informa-
tion about them for news sto-
ries. The database is composed
of voluntary and anonymous
reports about aviation safety
filed by passengers, pilots, and
controllers – anyone is eligible
to file. The data is rich with de-
tailed narratives about events
such as the 1998 near collision
between two foreign jumbo jets
at JFK International Airport in
New York.

INSIDE NICAR
New faces, changes
at database library
By David Herzog, NICAR and Missouri School of Journalism

Fall is a season of change-something
that holds true at the IRE and NICAR
offices. Each new school year at the
University of Missouri brings new staff
members to our Database Library.

So I thought I'd introduce the new
graduate assistants working in the
database library. Chances are, if you
call to order data or ask us a ques-
tion, you'll speak to one of them.

Christina Caron is a first-year
master's student who has spent the
past three years managing and col-
lecting outcomes data at the Dana-
Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.

Megan Clarke is also a first-year
master's student who has interned
with KEVN-Rapid City, S.D., and Wis-
consin Public Radio.

Hsuju Ho is a second-year master's stu-
dent who started working in the Data-
base Library last year as a volunteer.
She has interned at major English and
Chinese newspapers in Taipei, Taiwan.

Tad Vezner is a second-year master's
student who switched to journalism af-
ter a career in social work and public
relations. He was director of commu-
nications for the Epilepsy Foundation
of Greater Chicago. Since making the
switch to journalism, he has reported
for The (Toledo) Blade.

We also have two new Database Li-
brary volunteers: incoming master's
students Florence Kizza and Andrea
Lorenz.

Second-year master's students Jaimi
Dowdell and Holly Hacker have re-
turned to the Database Library.

Two former Database Library staffers
have departed. Megan Christensen
got her master's degree and is report-
ing for the Detroit Free Press.
Stephanie Kang is reporting for The
Wall Street Journal in Los Angeles.

FIRST VENTURE
Party town arrest
patterns uncovered

By Shelley Nelson, Duluth (Minn.) News-Tribune

Duluth's city council has a theory –
keep the bars open an hour later and
you'll keep the money from flowing over
the bridges that connect Duluth, Minn.,
and Superior, Wis.

Superior police officers scoff at the
idea.

Superior's reputation as a "party town"
is nearly as old and well-documented
as the city's history. The availability of
cheap alcohol and a wide variety of
bars and nightclubs in a 10-block area
of a 45-square-mile city create a nightlife
culture that is far different from Duluth's.

As I talked to Superior police officers
trying to gauge the expected impact of
a later bar closing time in Duluth on
law enforcement in Superior, I discov-
ered most police officers didn't think it
would make a difference. The size of
Superior's larger-than-average police
department has long been attributed
to late-night partying and violations
committed when alcohol is consumed.

One night shift officer told me that if
the police department could close off
the bridges at night, about half their
problems would go away. Several oth-
ers on the night shift agreed with him.

I was skeptical.

I read police arrest logs routinely.
Simple observation suggests a lot
more Superior residents are arrested
than Duluth residents.

That's where the computer-assisted
reporting techniques that I learned at
an IRE and NICAR Boot Camp earlier
this year came in.

Addresses are key
Getting the data to answer those ques-
tions was the easy part. Department
command staffers were willing to ac-
commodate my request.

The database itself was a problem.

The lack of a system expert proved to
be the biggest difficulty. The depart-
ment doesn't have the know-how on
staff to retrieve the full body of infor-
mation. The system expert retired sev-
eral months before and was never re-
placed because of budget constraints.

That meant I had to manually enter
home addresses of arrestees from re-
ports to find out where Superior's
crime problems were coming from.
While the data included arrest dates
and times, arresting officer, arrest dis-
trict, incident numbers, the suspect's
name and birth date, and charges
leveled at the time of arrest, staff had
no way of retrieving the data to in-
clude the arrestees' home addresses.

The data was provided in text format. I
did an initial import into Microsoft Ex-
cel 2003 to conduct a visual review of
the data to make sure it imported
cleanly. From there, I saved it as an
Excel file to import into Microsoft Access.

Deadlines limited the number of
records that could be updated with
the addresses of arrestees, but
throughout the input process – every
100 records - I tested the database
to determine how much difference
there was in the number of arrestees
from various communities and states.
I saved the query to avoid having to
rewrite it each time.

Throughout the gathering process,
the difference - the percentage of
people arrested coming from various
local communities was fairly small,
varying from 0.3 to 1.2 percent at any
point in the collection process.

Uplink

Ready to write
After acquiring home addresses for
about 1,800 of more than 2,300 ar-
rest reports, covering a year ending
in August, it was time to write. The
consistent testing made me comfort-
able that the data fairly represented
the arrestees.

With Access, I looked at the times of
day and locations of arrest to determine
where and when Superior police had
their greatest problems. I looked at the
types of charges leveled at the time of
arrest. I looked at the home address
of arrestees citywide, and then focused
on the trouble areas and times, deter-
mining the home addresses of people
arrested in the entertainment district
and where those arrestees were com-
ing from.

I copied and pasted Access query re-
sults into an Excel workbook for analy-
sis. I could easily tab through the in-
formation as I wrote.

That allowed me to test my query logic
without relying on recollection, and in
one case, catch an erroneous result. It
also allowed me to look at the results
to see what was happening and deter-
mine what type of graphics would best
tell the story.

It also proved handy when it came time
to pass along information to the Duluth
News-Tribune's one-man graphics de-
partment.

Data findings, interviews
The findings substantiated what offic-
ers were saying about the draw of
Superior's party-town culture and what
they observed on patrol.

Superior residents accounted for
about 60 percent of all arrests made
by the department, but Duluth resi-
dents accounted for more arrests
made in the entertainment district
between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. In that
time frame and area, only about 33
percent of people arrested in the en-
tertainment district and 27 percent ar-
rested during those hours actually
lived in Superior. Overall, Duluth resi-

Breaking news
As major news breaks, IRE and
NICAR update their Web pages
to help journalists get a head
start in reporting. When Hurri-
cane Isabel struck North Caro-
lina and Virginia, IRE and
NICAR added hurricane story
ideas, tipsheets and databases
to the growing list of breaking
news resources.

Although this year's hurricane
season is over, many of the re-
sources can be tapped during
other disasters. See www.ire.org/

NICAR UPDATE
New service opens door
to most recent data
By Hsuju Ho, IRE and NICAR

Deadline pressure can force journal-
ists to set aside their data because of
the time it takes to process and digest
it. The IRE and NICAR Database Li-
brary now has a solution to that prob-
lem: a user-friendly online subscription
service that provides cleaned and up-
dated databases for instant use.

In the past, the Database Library staff
took government data orders from
journalists and made the data avail-
able on CD or via FTP download. Jour-
nalists can still purchase data this way
and use the online subscription ser-
vice to report on breaking news.

The online subscription service, in-
troduced in spring 2003, allows jour-
nalists to obtain data as fast as a gov-
ernment agency updates it. IRE and
NICAR set up a special Web page
for each subscriber and links that
page to the latest available data files.

Twenty news organizations have
signed on so far.

The Database Library processes the
data and puts it in a format that is
easy to use with Microsoft Access,
FoxPro or other database managers.
The service also includes the record
layouts and other documentation.

The service not only provides a
shortcut for journalists who lack the
time to deal with raw data, it also
helps save time for journalists who
could process the data themselves
but would rather spend their time on
other pursuits.

Another advantage of the online ser-
vice is that it makes data available to
subscribers any time. Subscribers
can download the data when they
like, even on weekends.

The databases that are offered are re-
leased weekly or monthly by govern-
ment agencies and then immediately
processed by the Database Library.
News organizations can update their own
database as frequently as they wish.

Weekly data updates offered on the
service include the Federal Aviation
Administration Accidents and Incident
database, the FAA Service Difficulty
Reports and Federal Election Com-
mission campaign contributions.

...it helps save time
for journalists...

Monthly data updates include the FAA
Aircraft Registry, FAA Airmen Direc-
tory and the Internal Revenue Service
tax-exempt organization database.

The Database Library is adding data-
bases from its extensive collection
slowly to ensure proper processing
and the accuracy of the data. Keep
an eye on the IRE and NICAR
listservs for additions to the online
service.

Subscribers also have the option of
getting the data updates on CD every
month.

and more information about the online
subscription service, contact Jeff Por-
ter, director of the Database Library by

MAPPING
IT OUT
The latest uses of mapping
in news reporting.

Finding a
snow job
after storm

By Janet Roberts
St. Paul Pioneer Press

Our story began when a reporter's
friend woke up one winter morning
to find her car had been towed.
She'd come face to face with St.
Paul's confusing snow-emergency
rules, which govern on-street park-
ing after a significant snowfall.

Over lunch that day, the reporter and
his colleagues wondered whether
the rules are applied fairly. Are some
neighborhoods towed more heavily
than others?

With a few computer-assisted in-
vestigations under his belt, re-
porter Chuck Laszewski knew he
could answer that question. ESRI
ArcView 3.2 geographic informa-
tion system (GIS) software - and
a powerful extension called Spa-
tial Analyst - would make it pos-
sible. All Laszewski needed was
the right data.

Confusion aside, the snow-emer-
gency rules make sense: Plows
can't get the snow off the streets
if parked cars are in the way. If
streets aren't plowed clean, neigh-
bors cope with a mess of frozen
slop that can last all winter long.

But the rules cause a lot of conster-
nation for newcomers and even
long-time residents who pay them
too little mind.

Laszewski set out to get ticketing
and towing data.

It would be the following winter be-
fore we sat down at our computer
and began mapping. To make a long
story short, it took more than six
months — and the intervention of
our lawyer — to wrest towing
records from the St. Paul Police
Department. The ticket records
proved to be an even bigger hurdle,
so Laszewski spent about three
weeks' time, spread over five
months, typing in ticket addresses
for one snow emergency about
1,200 in all.

Now we were ready to fire up
ArcView, right? Not so fast.

Imagine it's just snowed more than
3 inches. A bunch of tow-truck driv-
ers go to work. It's cold. It's wet. It
might even be dark. The drivers get
out of their trucks, hitch the car to
their rigs and - oh, yeah
scribble down the address. Then
it becomes the job of a clerk at the
Public Works Department to deci-
pher that scrawl and type the ad-
dress into the database.

You can imagine how clean the ad-
dress field was. We had gems such
as "CAR X HUH?" Other records
contained street names but no
house numbers. The "good" ad-
dresses were listed this way:
"Sherburne/1033." I used Microsoft
SQL Server and VB Script to parse
the address field and format it in a
way ArcView would recognize.

My first pass at geocoding the records
asking ArcView to plot the tow lo-
cations on a street map - yielded a
disappointing success rate, so it was
back to address cleaning. Fewer than
two-thirds of the addresses plotted,
so I spent the better part of a week
examining the records that failed to
geocode and correcting misspellings.
Ultimately, we had an 88 percent suc-
cess rate - lower than I like, but the
best we could do for this project.

Concentration of tows
Finally, we could begin our analy-
sis. Immediately, we noticed the
tows appeared to concentrate north
of Grand Avenue, a commercial
thoroughfare that roughly divides
the city in half from east to west.
Indeed, a quick count in ArcView
and a few calculations in Microsoft
Excel showed 78 percent of the tows
were north of Grand. We had a story.

The Grand Avenue observation
would become part of our nut graf:
"It's almost as if the towing compa-
nies and city officials stood on
Grand Avenue and drew a line in the
snow. To the south, considerably
fewer cars get hauled away."

Next, we overlaid a map of the
neighborhood boundaries and did
a spatial join to assign each towing
record to its neighborhood. Export-
ing the data back to SQL Server, I
summed the records by neighbor-
hood. Clearly, towing was heavier in
some neighborhoods. But we won-
dered if that was because more
scofflaws parked in those neighbor-
hoods. Enter our ticketing data.

In ArcView, I geocoded the ticket-
ing data Laszewski had gathered.
Here, there was no "line in the
snow." Ticketing was dispersed
fairly evenly across the city. Again,
I summed by neighborhood. With
those totals in hand, I was able to
compute each neighborhood's tow
rate: the number of tows as a per-
centage of tickets issued.

We found wild variation: The neigh-
borhoods with the most tickets had
some of the lowest tow rates. Neigh-
borhoods with far fewer tickets had
high tow rates.

Fine-tuning with extension
Our story was getting better. But we
wanted to make more sense of our
data. In particular, we wondered
where the densest concentrations
of tows were. Common sense told
us they probably were in areas clos-
est to the impound lot, where towed
cars are taken. We knew - because
we used ArcView to draw one-mile
buffers around the impound lot and
counted the tows in each circle -
that 68 percent happened within
four miles of the impound lot.

It was difficult, however, to see con-
centrations in the geocoded points.
Because we mapped so many tows,
they all blended together into a blob
of largely undecipherable color.

Enter Spatial Analyst, an ArcView
extension that can do density analy-
sis. We didn't have the software,
and at $2,500, it's not cheap. So we
sought help from a college mapping
instructor. We brought our data to
her lab, and she showed us how to
use Spatial Analyst to draw our hot
spots. The result was eye opening.

We drew separate hot-spot maps
for the ticketing and the towing data.
The density patterns did not corre-
spond. In particular, a definite con-
centration of ticketing on the city's
West Side lacked any correspond-
ing concentration in the towing map.

Where did the towing hot spots con-
centrate? Around the impound lot.

Now, not only did we have a story,
we had a great publishable map and
good reason to buy the Spatial Ana-
lyst software.

With time to play with our own soft-
ware we tested several more theo-
ries: that towing patterns would cor-
respond with density of population,
rental housing, retail development
and immigrant populations (lan-
guage barriers make it hard for im-
migrants to understand the compli-
cated parking rules).

All of these theories had some truth.

But they didn't explain why the city
wasn't towing on the densely popu-
lated West Side, an area with many
Hispanic immigrants, dense clus-
ters of rental housing and a high
ticketing rate.

This is where Laszewski's shoe-
leather reporting was invaluable.
Tow-truck operators told him they
are loath to cross the Mississippi
River to tow on the West Side be-
cause it is a long round-trip to the
impound lot. The city's towing con-
tracts offer incentives to operators
the more cars they tow. Towing op-
erators said they focus their efforts
north of Grand Avenue because that
strategy yields the most cars.

The city's public works director, who
coincidentally lives in the seldom-
towed West Side neighborhood,
said he would review city policies
in light of our story. Across the river
in Minneapolis, city officials were so
enchanted with our analysis, they
did a similar one of their own, find-
ing the same disparate patterns.

SPOTLIGHT: CITY GOVERNMENT
Showing contributions
from strip-club workers

By David Washburn, The San Diego Union-Tribune

At first blush it sounds like the premise
for an episode of a TV drama chroni-
cling the adventures of a hard-nosed
newspaper reporter:

The reporter hears rumors that a strip
club owner from Las Vegas bribed a
few city councilmen, hoping that they
will push through legislation that
would allow more touching between
strippers and their customers. The FBI
gets wind of it and plans an afternoon
raid at city hall.

The reporter gets a tip about the raid
from her sources at city hall. The raid
goes off as planned and the reporter
has a blockbuster story.

That's what happened in San Diego.
FBI agents in May visited the offices
of city council members Ralph
Inzunza, Charles Lewis and Michael
Zucchet and seized their files, tele-
phone records and computer hard
drives. Federal agents suspected the
three had solicited bribes from Michael
Galardi, the owner of two strip clubs in San
Diego and several more in Las Vegas.

That was where the similarities be-
tween a TV script and reality ended.

In TV-land, the strip club kingpin hires
a couple of goons to whack the city
councilmen. The reporter walks in on
the goons getting ready to do the dirty
deed. Using her martial arts skills, she
knocks out the goons and the grateful
councilmen confess.

But in real life everybody hired lawyers,
the FBI stayed quiet and all the jour-
nalists in town hounded their frazzled
city hall sources. Following the money
and establishing a link between the
councilmen and the strip club owner
through traditional reporting was far
easier said than done.

This is the spot Union-Tribune re-
porter Caitlin Rother found herself in
during the days after the raid. She
heard lots of rumors about Galardi
and the councilmen but little in the
way of hard facts.

She later got some of the hard facts
from a database of campaign contri-
butions that we built on the fly using
Microsoft Access.

An analysis of the database showed
that people involved in the adult enter-
tainment industry had given more than
$20,000 to the three councilmen and
two other council members whose of-
fices were not searched by the FBI.

We were able to show that strippers
and bouncers were giving to the cam-
paigns of the three councilmen. Also,
we found thousands of dollars in con-
tributions coming from Nevada, espe-
cially from Las Vegas "homemakers."

Here is what else we found:
• Campaign finance reports varied in
the way they listed people associated
with the adult entertainment industry
and their occupations, employers and
home addresses. For example, some-
one listed as an entertainer or waitress
on one report would be listed on an-
other as a student, homemaker or
some other less obvious affiliation.
Some donors had unlisted occupations.

• Several people who were listed as
giving the maximum $250 contribution
to more than one candidate listed
apartment addresses in less-than-af-
fluent neighborhoods that usually are
not home to political donors.

• Many contributions from people in
the industry were given on the same
day. This fact helped Rother confirm
low-profile fund-raisers held by lob-
byists for the industry.

I was thrilled with the final results, but
wish that the database had been built
prior to the raid. The newsroom had not
realized before how important it is to
have a database of local campaign
contributions on hand.

Building the database
Rother needed to do a thorough analy-
sis of years worth of campaign contri-
butions, and she needed to do it fast.
The problem was that San Diego, like
the vast majority of municipalities, does
not require candidates to file their
contribution reports electronically. So
she ended up with a box filled with
dozens of reports containing thou-
sands of contributions.

I uttered a swear word and began
pounding my head on my desk. I had
been pushing for a few years to have
the newsroom create a database of
local contributions. These databases
are great for seeing who candidates
may be indebted to politically.

The editors had agreed and made cre-
ating the database a newsroom prior-
ity. But, as is so often happens in news-
rooms, the news of the day trumped
preparing for the future. The database
never got built, so we were caught un-
prepared when the city's biggest po-
litical scandals in a decade hit.

Nonetheless, we decided that a data-
base of contributions to the three coun-
cilmen and two other council members
who we knew had received money from
Galardi was crucial for our reporting.

I created a table for the contributions
and then built a data-entry form using
Access' form wizard. Whenever pos-
sible, I used tools on the form to speed
the data entry. For instance, someone
could pick the name of a city council
member from a list to enter that name
into the recipient field of the table.

After that, we rounded up some news
assistants, brought in a temp with data-
entry skills and went to work entering

Uplink

details such as the name, address,
occupation and employer of the con-
tributor. We also entered the amount
given and to which council member.

After more than a week of grueling data
entry we had three years of contribu-
tions for the five council members.

Not long after that I caught a mistake.
Some contributions had been entered
twice because of addendum reports
filed by the candidates. When candi-
dates need to make a correction or
addition to a report, they file the entire
report over again, which means that,
in some cases, the same contribution
is reported twice.

It is easy to spot an addendum if you
are looking for it. But a few slipped
through. So I spent another day typing
the data from the addendums into a
table and then joining that table to the
main table to identify the duplicates and
remove them using a delete records
query. We ended up with 7,500 records.

While the news assistants and I built
the database, Rother mined her
sources for names of people associ-
ated with Galardi. She compiled more
than two dozen names with suspected
ties. We queried the database to see
whether they had contributed and
found that almost everyone on the list
had given to the candidates. And we
found that a vast majority of those
people worked for Galardi. In addition,
we noticed that their occupations had
been listed differently.

A federal grand jury indicted the three
councilmen, Galardi and two lobby-
ists in August. All of them were
charged with wire fraud and five of
the six with extortion.

The time and the effort that went into
the database were worth it and bol-
stered the story. Our earlier stories
about the federal probe would have
been much stronger if we had built the
database sooner and used it.

SPOTLIGHT: CITY GOVERNMENT
Spreadsheet, good eye
help find missing money

By Paul Egan, Freelance

When political candidates fail to report
receiving campaign contributions, the
money has essentially disappeared.

Unless the contributor reports the
candidate's failure to publicly report
the money, which is unlikely, there is
almost no way of knowing the candi-
date ever received it.

The exception is with contributions
from political action committees. Un-
like individuals, whose contributions
are only reported by the candidates
who receive them, PACs must file
public reports that detail their politi-
cal contributions.

Using a spreadsheet or database
manager to compare the contributions
that PACs report making to a candi-
date with those the candidate reported
receiving from the same PACs is an
excellent way of testing the accuracy
and integrity of a candidate's cam-
paign-finance reporting.

In July, The Detroit News used
Microsoft Excel to conduct such an ex-
amination of Detroit Mayor Kwame
Kilpatrick, a former Democratic minor-
ity leader in the Michigan House of
Representatives. Over the two-year
period studied, 1999-2000, The News
found that PACs reported writing 30
checks totaling $16,650 to Kilpatrick's
state House campaign fund that
Kilpatrick never reported receiving.
Journalists could use a database man-
ager, such as Microsoft Access, to
match the data, especially where there
are many contributions.

Raising questions
Three factors prompted the News to
take a look.

First, the PAC money Kilpatrick's state
House fund reported receiving — a
little over $120,000 over the two-year
period - appeared low relative to
other state legislators in leadership
positions.

Second, Kilpatrick had a history of non-
compliance with state campaign fi-
nance laws, accumulating more than
$13,000 in fines over five years for late
filing of reports to the state and county.

Third, the state had recently refused
Kilpatrick's request to dissolve his
state House committee, because of
reporting discrepancies of between
$1,400 and $2,900 - much smaller
discrepancies than those uncovered
by the News.

Without a computer the analysis
would have been next to impossible.
Even with one, it required consider-
able drudgework.

In Michigan, where some committees
file electronically and others still file
paper reports, data on candidate re-
ceipts and PAC contributions is sup-
posed to be easily accessible in elec-
tronic format. Data filed electronically
is added to the Michigan Secretary of
State campaign finance database that
can be queried on the Web (see http://
miboecfr.nicusa.com/cgi-bin/cfr/
contrib_anls.cgi.) State workers manu-
ally enter information filed on the pa-
per reports into the same database.

Getting a file of Kilpatrick's reported
contributions was simple: I punched
in the candidate's name, set the date
parameters for 1999 and 2000, and
downloaded an Excel file with all the
reported receipts. Then I deleted the
records of contributions from indi-
vidual contributors, leaving only 109
PAC contributions.

Getting a file of contributions that
PACs reported making to Kilpatrick in
1999 and 2000 was much more diffi-
cult. Most PACs file on paper. The
state uses the candidate reports as
its source of PAC contribution data.
So Kirkpatrick's unreported PAC con-
tributions would be missing.

The only way to get the data was to
examine scanned reports from all
1,000 or so Michigan PACS during
1999 and 2000 and manually create a
spreadsheet of contributions they re-
ported making to Kilpatrick. Using a
similar format to the first spreadsheet,
my new table included a column for the
name of the contributor, one for the
amount of the contribution, and one for
the reported contribution date.

Contributions reported to Kilpatrick by
the PACs had 145 records. Since the
databases were relatively small, I sorted
each spreadsheet alphabetically by
contributor and used my eyes to do the
matching, striking out pairs of contri-
butions and receipts until I was left with
a list of what appeared to be unreported
contributions. If I were to try a similar
analysis again, I'd clean up the files,
load them into Access and try joining
them by contributor name and amount.

Checking on the PACS
Looking at the unmatched contribu-
tions, I saw that I still had plenty of
work ahead.

PACs are sometimes known by more
than one name, and it's important to
check for inconsistencies between
the name used by the contributor and
the one used by the recipient when
recording the contribution.

We found instances with matching
contributors but differing contribution
amounts. Because there was no easy
way to determine which table con-
tained the correct amount, the News
did not include these contributions in
its results and focused solely on con-
tributions that were not reported at all
by Kilpatrick's committee.

It's also possible that a contributor re-
ported making the contribution within

10
November • December 2003
==End of OCR for page 10==

==Start of OCR for page 11==
the time period covered by the analy-
sis, but the candidate did not report
receiving it until a later time period.
For that reason, we searched all re-
ports filed by the candidate after the
time period covered by the analysis.

Contributions can go astray in other
ways. For example, the News found
instances in which a PAC reported
contributing to Kilpatrick's campaign
committee, but Kilpatrick reported de-
positing the money into his own po-
litical action committee, called Gen-
erations. Since he reported the con-
tributions as received somewhere,
these were not included as missing.

Interestingly, among the missing con-
tributions the News found were two
totaling $3,150 that Kilpatrick's PAC
reported making to his campaign
committee but his campaign commit-
tee never reported receiving.

Lost in the mail?
Another problem to be aware of is
contribution checks that get lost in the
mail or become outdated because
they are not cashed quickly enough.
In those cases, Michigan law requires
the PAC to adjust the balance by re-
porting the amount of the lost or
uncashed checks as "other income"
in a subsequent report.

It makes sense, then, that the time
period chosen for the analysis should
be far enough in the past so such
anomalies can be discovered and ac-
counted for in the reports. That was
one of the reasons the News exam-
ined the final two years when
Kilpatrick was in the state House,
rather than the period during his more
recent job as mayor of Detroit.

As a further check, the News con-
tacted a sample of the PACs that re-
ported making contributions to
Kilpatrick that Kilpatrick never re-
ported receiving. Contributors con-
firmed that at least eight of the unre-
ported checks, totaling $5,150, had
cleared the bank.

After the News published its report,
a spokesman for Kilpatrick acknowl-
edged that there appeared to be a re-
porting problem and said Kilpatrick's
committee had hired an attorney who
specialized in financial matters to try
to resolve the issues.

continued from page 1

quickly add, subtract, order from high-
est to lowest, find the average or me-
dian and calculate percentage in-
creases. I had to learn Microsoft Excel.

Now, I realize I risk ridicule here.
Many readers of this publication are
interested in how to write the short-
est program to sort through millions
of government records in Microsoft
Access or FoxPro.

But I also know many local govern-
ment reporters who find themselves
too busy to regularly build spread-
sheets for their stories. I've come to
find those spreadsheets are essen-
tial in almost every story. In fact, they
can help a reporter take more con-
trol of the beat and its stories by gen-
erating information - and stories -
that no one else has.

What I will attempt to detail here is
some of the key data sets on the lo-
cal government beat, how I used
them to build spreadsheets and the
stories that resulted.

The questions that prompted my re-
quests for the data or documents I
used to build the spreadsheets are
basic to most any beat.

How much does that government of-
ficial make?

How much does that perk or program
cost taxpayers?

Start with your local government's an-
nual budget. It should break down ex-
penses in a general way. Look for any
interesting notes and be sure to com-
pare that budget to previous years,
to search for major changes.

Also be sure to obtain a copy of the
annual management letter, normally
done by outside auditors. It should de-
tail problems in financial controls, rec-
onciliation of accounts and other prob-
lems related to revenue collections.

The city budget also should total per-
sonnel costs. But you'll need to dig a
bit deeper to find out which govern-
ment employees have the best deals
in the way of pay.

Personnel and payroll
You need basic salary information
about everyone. That should include
name, department, salary, overtime
and any other pay. A quick and easy
story could focus on how many offi-
cials earn more than $100,000. You
might be surprised by what you find.
In Kansas City, we found 60 city offi-
cials in the "$100,000 club."

Then focus on the overtime. Exam-
ine by departments. What are the
trends over the years? Examine also
by individuals. Did any employees
double or greatly boost their annual
pay with overtime?

Start with your
local government's
annual budget.

I obtained some of this information
electronically. It was in a rather clunky
form, however. It was organized by
payroll date - so each employee had
26 entries per year. I imported the
data to Excel, then created pivot
tables on the names to group all pay-
roll information. Then, I sorted in de-
scending order.

Another angle to pursue on overtime
is to look at how often city officials,
including police and fire, are paid for
overtime they don't actually work. In
Kansas City, police are paid a mini-
mum of four hours overtime for a call-
back, even if they only work one hour.
The Star obtained a few weeks of the
police department's callback sheets,
which detailed the actual time worked
versus the amount paid.

Using a spreadsheet, I logged each
callback, the amount paid in overtime
and the amount actually worked.

Perks
A number of basic, but interesting, city
or county records will be a good start-
ing point in determining the perks that
your local government employees enjoy.

Early retirement programs are popu-
lar today as local governments at-
tempt to trim budgets. Obtain a list of
every employee, position, salary,
years of service and monthly retire-
ment payment. I used such a list,
building most of it by entering the data
myself, when about 350 employees
opted for an early retirement program
in Kansas City.

With the spreadsheet, I was able to
detail who was receiving the largest
monthly retirement payments, the av-
erage payment, the years of service lost
to the city and losses by department.

And then there are cell phones. When
I set up shop in city hall, I quickly
found it difficult to find any official by
leaving a message on their office
phone. The best way to reach them, I
found, was on their city cell phone.
That, of course, prompted the ques-
tion: How much does that cost tax-
payers?

Using an open-records request, I ob-
tained electronic data about each cell
phone, its city user, department and
total monthly bill for three months. We
totaled the three months of bills by
user, then ranked them.

We filed another open-records re-
quest, asking for detailed billing in-
formation about the top 25 users. That
revealed that many, including two city
council members, were abusing their
phones or racking up exorbitant bills.
Others were doing work on their cell
phones, but they were on the wrong
plans, regularly exceeding their allot-
ted "free" minutes.

Take-home vehicles traditionally are
another city or county government

12
November • December 2003
==End of OCR for page 12==

==Start of OCR for page 13==
perk. We requested the number and
assignments of vehicles by city de-
partment. The city auditor had stud-
ied this a couple years earlier, so we
compared our update figures to those
in the city audit, creating a spread-
sheet by department to track the in-
creases or decreases.

To flesh out the story a bit more, we
also obtained logs of city employees
assigned to vehicles, which showed
how often they use the vehicles for
something other than commuting to
and from work.

Property records
Be sure to obtain copies of county as-
sessment records. These could be a
foundation for a number of stories.
Who has had the highest or smallest
increases in assessment?

Also ask for delinquent property
records, which may tip you off about
local developers and businesses in
trouble. Who owes the most in back
taxes? Do many property owners al-
low their property tax bills to go de-
linquent for two years or more before
paying the bill?

In addition, cities must create inven-
tories of their city property. Check the
city's real estate lists, matching city-
owned addresses against lists of
code violators. I recently found that
the city owned land on which illegal
junkyards were being operated.

Other fun records
Inspection records of restaurants,
swimming pools, day-care centers
and even salvage yards can produce
great stories. Plug into a spreadsheet
the inspection dates, findings,
investigator's names and other docu-
ment information. Patterns will
emerge that you might not have
caught otherwise. Also, spreadsheets
are a great tool for keeping the infor-
mation close at hand.

I recently had fun by obtaining city
water department listings of water
use at city-owned sites, including the
city zoo and numerous fountains. With
that information in a spreadsheet, we
could calculate the amount of "free"
water going to city sites.

The city kept spreadsheets on its free
water users, including their ad-
dresses and the amount of water per
month. With that information, we cal-
culated usage per hour for some foun-
tains and compared it to the average
monthly usage of a family of four. We
also toured several of these sites with
water officials to refine our calcula-
tions.

Then there was water lost through
leaks. In some areas the department
lost as much as half of its water and
ended up collecting fees for only two-
thirds of the water it had treated for
distribution. Big leaks happen not only
in Kansas City but also in almost ev-
ery city east of the Mississippi River
because of the age of the city water
distribution systems.

Finally, The Star also recently ob-
tained the parking records for munici-
pal judges, who had long been ac-
cused of working short hours in the
city courthouse.

For many courthouses, this idea of
using parking records to mark their
workweeks would probably not work.
But for judges whose cases are all
heard from the bench in a docket-
style fashion and where little legal
research is required, it seemed like a
good way to determine how much
time the judges were spending on city
business in the courthouse.

For this story, though, I had to advance
beyond spreadsheets, enlisting the
support of Greg Reeves, the
newspaper's FoxPro guru, to sort
through the electronic swipes of
judges, who used cards to come in and
out of the courthouse parking garage.

With Reeves' help, I had moved be-
yond Excel. But it would never have
been possible without those initial
steps 18 months ago into the world
of spreadsheets.

Now, let's check out a few features
of SAS System Viewer. First, notice
that the column headers are some-
what cryptic. So go to the View menu

little nicer-looking in Figure 2. Prefer
just the shorter version? Toggle back
to headers.

You can also view the variables, too,

Now, some final few steps to make the

cally, if I'm going to use a file in

are my preference. So consider how

Now, you've saved the file as a text file

percent of all arrests, but 37 percent
of the arrests made in the entertain-

arrests made between 11 p.m. and 3

I was surprised by the results, but
when I went back to talk to officers
who work the night shift about the
problems they deal with, they weren't
surprised at all. That was what they
expected based on their patrol expe-
rience and what they were talking
about during earlier discussions.

Since the story ran on Sept. 8, the Su-
perior city council has gotten behind the
chief's efforts to create a satellite police
office in the city's entertainment district.
It's also prompted the chief to look into
ways to make people who live outside

SAS isn't the most common data type
that government agencies post on their
Web sites, so you probably won't use
the SAS System Viewer every day.
Even government agencies that pro-
cess data with SAS have the ability to
provide the data in almost any way you

ate and city residents bear.

It has also prompted the chief to seek
better training for his records staff so
they can look at the information in dif-
ferent ways. It's training that will be
useful a year after the new Duluth bar
closing time goes into effect and I look
back to see if the extended drinking
time makes a difference in Superior's
law enforcement efforts.

The one finding that really took me by
surprise - and the records staff was
able to verify - is the number of un-
derage drinking arrests police make.
The vast majority of those types of ar-
rests in the entertainment district occur
around one nightclub during its "dry"
nights, a weekly alcohol-free event.

That's a story for another day.

Tech tip...
Geometry, scripting find nearby points

By Brad Heath, The Detroit News

Your state is pondering a new law:
No convicted sex offenders should
live within a mile of a day-care cen-
ter. But what's the context? To find
out, you need to answer two ques-
tions: How many sex offenders ac-
tually live near each day-care cen-
ter in your neighborhood and, for
each one, exactly how far away is
the nearest offender?

You know how to start answering
these questions using your geo-
graphic information system (GIS)
program — I used ESRI ArcView
3.2. You've already used
geocoding to turn a data table of
day-care center street addresses
in your community into a point
map, and did the same for a table
of convicted sex offenders. So now
all you have to do is count up
which ones are near each other.

How?

That's where it gets interesting.

ArcView will need to go through and
check each day-care center for the
closest sex offender. And it will have
to count how many offender points
are within a mile of each center.
That's simple to do by hand if you're
only looking at one or two facilities.
But what if you're looking at dozens,
or thousands?

ArcView doesn't come with that abil-
ity. You have to build it yourself us-
ing ArcView's scripting language,
called Avenue. Once you learn Av-
enue you can make ArcView do
pretty much anything.

In this case, it's using coordinate
geometry. To answer the questions,
you'll need to fill out both themes
with accurate x and y coordinates.
Then you can use scripts or queries
to search through the data to figure
out which sex offenders are closest
to the day-care centers.

Step one is creating the coordi-
nates. If you have a point theme in
ArcView, odds are you're dealing in
latitude and longitude - decimal
degrees. While these are flexible,
they aren't the best for measuring
distance, so you need to put some
coordinates in your data.

Start by changing the projection of
your view. Switch to the NAD 1983
projection for your state plane.
(These projections are built in to
ArcView 3.x.) Also, change the dis-
tance and map units to feet. Then
open the attributes table for the
theme you want to work on first.
Start editing it and add two fields:
"ProjX" and "ProjY". Set them up as
numeric and be sure to allow for
several decimal places. Close the
table but don't hit the "Stop Editing"
button yet.

Now you're ready to add some co-
ordinates. To do it, you'll need an
Avenue script that cycles through
each record and retrieves the x and
y coordinates that correspond to the
map projection you've chosen. The
code looks like this:

curView =
av.GetProject. FindDoc("mymap")
thmToUpdate =
curView.FindTheme(".shp")
tabToUPdate =
thmToUpdate.GetFTab
prjView curView.GetProjection
fldShape =
tabToUPdate.FindField("Shape")
fldProjX =
tabToUpdate.FindField("projx")
fidProjY =
tabToUpdate.FindField("projy")

for each rec in tabToUpdate

curRec
tabToUpdate. ReturnValue(fldShape,
rec)

Projx =
curRec. ReturnProjected(prjView).Getx
Projy
curRec. Return Projected(prjView).Gety

tabToUpdate.SetValue (fldProjX,
rec, ProjX)
tabToUpdate.SetValue(fl@ProjY,
rec, Prajy)

end

After you enter the code, make sure
you update it with the name of your
view and theme. Then compile it
with the checkmark icon and run it.

Now back to your table. Look at
the ProjX and ProjY fields and they
should be filled in with numbers —
the eastings and northings of your
point. Instead of using latitude and
longitude, these coordinates iden-
tify a point based on how many
feet north and east it is from a pre-
defined point on the map. Click
"Stop Editing" and save the re-
sults. Then export the table you
just finished and repeat the pro-
cess for your second table. Import
both into Access.

This leaves you with a database, two
tables that lack a common field for
joining. But Microsoft Access and
other database managers will let you

16

Uplink

use more sophisticated relationships.

Instead of using a join, you can link
the points in the two tables using
the Pythagorean distance formula,
which can calculate the distance
between any two points on a plane
using their coordinates.

Here's how you'd use Access SQL to
link the tables based upon points that
are at most a mile (5,280 feet) apart:

WHERE.sqr(((daycare.ProjX -
offenders.ProjX) ^2) +
((daycare.Projy-
offenders.ProjY) ^2)) <= 5280

Now you can insert that into a SQL
statement to answer the two ques-
tions.

First: How many sex offenders live
within a mile of each day-care cen-
ter? You'll want a query that will
check the data and count every
point where the distance is less than
5,280 feet. Here's the SQL:

SELECT daycare.Name,
Count (offenders.Name) AS
offenders_within_mile
FROM daycare, offenders
WHERE

(((Sqr((((offenders.projx-
daycare.projx)^2)+((offenders.projy-
daycare.projy)^2))))<5280) AND
((daycare.projX) Is Not Null)
AND ((offenders.projX) Is Not
Null))
GROUP BY daycare.Name;

It's important that your query filter
out null values, which will appear
in any records that you were un-
able to geocode. Even if only one
record wasn't coded to a spot on
the map, the null value will cause
Access to choke.

Second: How far from each day-
care center is the nearest sex of-
fender? You'll want a query that, for
each day-care center, chooses the
minimum result from the distance
calculation. Here's the SQL:

SELECT daycare.Name,
Min(Sqr((((offenders.projx-
daycare.projx)^2)+((offenders.projy-
daycare.projy)^2)))) AS dis-
tance
FROM daycare, offenders

WHERE (((daycare.projX) Is Not
Null) AND ((offenders.projX) Is
Not Null))

GROUP BY daycare.Name;

It's possible to handle these cal-
culations with Avenue (and you
don't even have to get
Pythagorean to do it, because the
language has a built-in distance
function). But bringing it back into
a database is easier, not to men-
tion much faster. And once you've
figured out how to do spatial math
in Access, it's easy to change your
analysis, ask different questions of
your data or bring in other data,
maybe the location of sex crimes
or neighborhood police stations.

What else can you do?

Why not find out how many sewer
pipes dump out near your
community's beaches? Or look at
whether fires are happening close
to the fire departments. You could
add the distance calculations to an
analysis of ambulance response
times. And you could incorporate it
into your Web site by creating
searches that let users find the day-
care centers closest to their homes.

other state affected by the disaster.

Those who study or work in the field of
remote sensing expect to see similar
projects from news organizations down
the road.

In a nutshell, remote sensing is the
science of gathering information
about the Earth from a distance. The
process typically involves sensing
energy (such as heat, visible light or
infrared radiation) that is emitted or
reflected by the Earth's surface or
atmosphere. This can be done in sev-
eral ways, from attaching a camera
to a hot-air balloon to sending a sat-
ellite hundreds of miles into space.

Remote sensing really isn't new to the
news business. Think of TV weather
maps showing satellite images of
clouds or rainfall, or aerial photographs
in newspapers.

Blending data, images
News organizations have embraced
remote sensing more in the past year,
largely because of the war in Iraq. They
have shown satellite images of
Baghdad, debris from the Columbia
space shuttle crash over Texas, and
areas in Washington, D.C., where the
snipers attacked.

The Post-Dispatch series took remote
sensing another step by blending other
data with satellite images to find and
tell a story. Environment reporter Sara
Shipley grew up near St. Louis and re-
members big floods in the 1980s. When
a job at the Post-Dispatch brought her
back to the area last year, she was
struck by all of the businesses and roads
that had sprouted on the flood plain.

Shipley wanted to measure how much
development had occurred since the
1993 flood, and to compare Missouri
to other Midwestern states. Existing
documents and data, such as permits
issued for flood plain development,
could not answer her questions. (The
permits are required only for federally
backed flood insurance, which not ev-
eryone obtains. Plus, the permits don't
cover all areas of a flood plain.)

So the newspaper hired GeoSpatial
Services (www.gis.smumn.edu), a re-
search group at Saint Mary's Univer-
sity in Minnesota, to analyze devel-
opment in areas of seven states af-
fected by the flood. To mark the flood
plain and areas that flooded in 1993,
the researchers used data from the
Scientific Assessment and Strategy
Team, a government group formed to
study the disaster.

The researchers also obtained current
and pre-flood satellite images from the
U.S. Geological Survey. Their third ma-
jor source of data, showing changes in
population and housing, came from the
U.S. Census for 1990 and 2000.

Remote sensing
can be costly.

After some cleaning and processing,
Saint Mary's researcher Jim Hipple
imported the satellite images (as geotiff
files), flooding and flood plain bound-
aries (as shapefiles) and Census block
data (as database files) into ArcEditor,
ESRI's mid-level GIS.

The Census figures helped Hipple
zoom in on areas with big jumps in
population. He also scrutinized the
pre- and post-flood satellite images
to scout out new highways, parking
lots, businesses and homes.

The satellite images had 30-meter
resolution - meaning each pixel of the
image represents a 30-by-30 meter
surface. To get clearer pictures with
higher resolution, Hipple used aerial
photographs to study areas with in-
tense development.

Hipple traced the outlines of post-flood
development using his mouse to cre-
ate polygons and place them in one of
four categories: industrial/commercial,
residential, highway/interchange and
recreational. Then he tallied the acres
of land developed in flood plain and
flooded areas since 1993.

Reporting results
The analysis revealed that Missouri
had developed more than 4,200 acres
of flood plain, more than any other state
affected by the flood. And nearly all of
Missouri's development had occurred
in the St. Louis area, in areas that sat
under water 10 years ago.

The series (www.sttoday.com/stitoday/
news/special/flood93.nsf/
front?openview&count=2000) then ex-
plained how lax state regulation and
the political climate in the St. Louis re-
gion allowed so much development in
areas that could someday end up un-
der water again.

"We were able to quantify it. That was
the biggest thing," Shipley said. And the
satellite images taken before and after
the flood drove home just how much
development had taken place. "When
you're sitting here on the ground, you
don't really get that perspective."

Remote sensing can be costly. The
Post-Dispatch paid $10,000 for the
analysis. Nor is buying remote pictures
from a commercial company cheap, at
least by most newsroom standards.
Images from Space Imaging
(www.spaceimaging.com) start at
$350, while those from DigitalGlobe
(www.digitalglobe.com) start at $562.
However, in an effort to tap into the
media market, both companies have
given images to some news organiza-
tions for free.

But journalists can do other projects
and use other data that cost less.

Images on the cheap
"There are many very good shoestring-
type projects that can be done using
imagery, sometimes as a thing unto it-
self, other times as a layer in a GIS,"
said Chris Simpson, who teaches jour-

links, the reporter can also pull up
the names of everyone else who do-
nated from that company or from
that profession.

But even with the wealth of data that
has been put up in newsrooms, a com-
mon complaint was that journalists fail
to use what's there.

"We're all such luddites in this indus-
try," said James Wilkerson, CAR edi-
tor at The Morning Call in Allentown,
Pa. The paper has an intranet with da-
tabases ranging from voter registration
files to crime incidents and arrests go-
ing back to the early 1990s. "There's a
handful of people who use it constantly
and some people who never use it."
