Firestone and Explorers

By Josh Barbanel

It was late in the day. We were up to our
ears in other projects when a business editor
interrupted with one of those vexing requests.
It was a nuisance - hardly worth the atten-
tion of one, not to mention two, highly sig-
nificant reporters in the new Investigative
Cluster of The New York Times.

"Can you help us open up this spread-
sheet," the editor asked.

Sigh.

CENSUS 2000
Heavy lifting ahead

By Richard O'Reilly
Los Angeles Times
The first wave of data from Census 2000
has washed ashore, providing some with an
exhilarating ride surfing the leading edge of
computer-assisted reporting. It may have been
more terrifying than thrilling for others, how-
ever.

Whichever situation you identify with, up-
coming data releases will be much, much more
challenging.

The data dictionary for PL94-171's four
tables of race and race and Latino/Hispanic
ethnicity was 10 pages long. For Summary File
1 coming this summer, the preliminary descrip-
tion runs 110 pages, and the final detailed list-
ing will be many times that length.

PL94-171 had a total of 288 population
count variables, plus the 80 geography vari-
ables.

Summary File 1 will have the sarne 80 ge-
ography variables plus 8,132 population and

complaints about deaths attributed to
Firestone tires on Ford Explorers. We clicked
on the table icon in the email, counted the
cases and were done. Back to our very im-
portant work.

But the next day, as my colleague Ford
Fessenden likes to say, serendipity happened.
We were discussing what we would have said,
if the editors had seen us as something more
than keyboard jockeys – and actually asked
for help in thinking about and dealing with
the rapidly developing story of the recall of
more than 14 million Firestone ATX and
Wilderness tires.

Well, we both had worked with govern-
ment accident data files. We knew that Ford
Motor Company was using warranty claims
data to monitor the problem (and make its
case that the problem was all the fault of
Bridgestone/Firestone). We knew the federal
government was relying on complaints called
in by survivors, lawyers and the auto compa-
nies.

If these complaints involved real people
killed in real fatal accidents, shouldn't we be
able to track at least some of the same cases
in the rich federal database of fatal accidents?

Hitting on Explorers
The editors never actually assigned us to
look into the Ford Explorers. But we poked
around, and they were fascinated when we
told them we were able to clearly trace a sig-
nificant surge in tire-related fatal accidents
in Ford Explorers, not found in other sport
utility vehicles.

This was remarkable (some may say de-
batable) because reports of tire-related deaths
were rare events. At the time, the federal gov-
ernment had complaints of 88 deaths in tire-
related accidents in the Ford Explorer, includ-
ing some going back many years.

TRANSPORTATION
Fatal highway

By Tony Manolatos
FLORIDA TODAY
Fatal-crash stories along Interstate 95
were almost becoming routine. During a
six-month period last year, 12 people were
killed in 11 separate accidents on Brevard
County's 73-mile stretch of Interstate 95.

One New York family, who lost their
parents in a March crash, wrote FLORIDA
TODAY and pleaded with reporters and
editors to take the coverage beyond spot-
news stories. They wanted to know the rea-
sons why their parents and many others
were dying on I-95. They wanted the news-
paper to illustrate the human toll.

We, too, saw the potential of the story.
But first we had to determine just how dan-
gerous the interstate, one of two main ar-
teries in Florida, really is.

A team of reporters and editors began
culling and analyzing state data from nearly
30,000 crashes over five years along
Florida's 382 miles of I-95. In an initial
10-page report on Dec. 3, 2000, we deliv-
ered the news that the number of people
killed on the Florida highway had doubled
over five years.

Gathering data for 1-95
required working with
four state transportation
districts and compiling
data from each district
into one database.

The data were startling enough, but the
process also was revealing and newswor-
thy. We learned that money was the big-
gest culprit impeding enhancements to the
road. But we also learned that while state
transportation officials collect crash data,
an aging computer system does not allow
those officials to thoroughly analyze the in-
formation to identify the causes of crashes.

In the 10-page report (called "I-95,
More Dangerous Than Ever") and the doz-
ens of stories, editorials, reader letters and
a public forum that followed, enough ur-
gency was raised to compel state and local
officials to take action. It was impossible
to ignore the findings of the report, includ-
ing:

• In 1996, there was a sudden and dra-
matic increase in the number of fatal
crashes on I-95. That was the year the speed
limit was raised to 70 mph from 65 mph.

• The death rate per I-95 mile driven in
Brevard County, home to FLORIDA TO-
DAY, is more than twice the national av-
erage for interstate highways.

• Almost a third of the fatal crashes in
Brevard County occur when vehicles veer
out of control across grass medians and into
oncoming traffic. Those "crossovers" lead
to more multiple-death crashes than any
other type of accident. They could be pre-
vented by erecting median barriers in high-
accident locations a fairly simple, low-
cost solution.

Comparisons
One thing the project did not do was
compare 1-95 to another road. We did
gather fatality rates for U.S. interstates and
Florida interstates and we compared those
to I-95. But we did not, for example, look
specifically at Interstate 75 in Florida.

We chose to compare I-95 to itself be-
cause it is Florida's eastern gateway and the
most heavily traveled road in the state.
However, taking the time to compare it to
I-75, Florida's other major highway, would
have added depth and perspective to our
report.

Gathering data for I-95 required work-
ing with four state transportation districts
and compiling data from each district into
one database. Because each district is in-
dependent of the other, no one at the state
level can effortlessly answer basic questions
such as the number of people killed in
any given year – about I-95, I-75 or any
other road that runs through multiple
transportation districts.

State transportation officials said a new cen-
tral computer system, expected to be in place
by July, would give them a better and quicker
understanding of state-maintained roads.

Fatal highway

While the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration tracks all fatal
wrecks in its Fatal Accident Reporting Sys-
tem database, the agency essentially relies
on police reports for the information.
Those reports often list multiple names of
one road and NHTSA's database does not
take that into account. In other words, you
would have to know every possible name
that law enforcement might use for a road
in order to properly crunch the numbers.

Analysis
Anthony DeBarros, a database editor for
USA TODAY, cleaned up the data, com-
piled it into one database and assisted with
the number crunching. We used Microsoft
Access. The database was 13 megabytes. We
also used Microsoft Excel for some import
work. The data was supplied to us at no
cost.

State transportation
officials said a new
central computer
system, expected to be
in place by July, would
give them a better and
quicker understanding
of state-maintained
roads.

"The data was in fixed-width text files,
but we discovered that one of the state
zones was missing a couple of years of data,
so we had to get that data and add it to
our database" DeBarros said.

"In terms of cleaning, all the data was
presented in code, and I spent consider-
able hours going through and converting
those codes into meaningful text that the
reporter could understand. Also, we had
to figure out how to piece together (sepa-
rate data from four districts) so we could
get a picture from end to end."

The CAR work took about two months
to complete as a side job. The project took
about four months to complete.

DeBarros mentioned that while we did
compile traffic data for 1-95, using it to
determine fatality rates, reporters who do
similar projects should keep in mind that
traffic volume must be figured into the
equation before a stretch of road can be
labeled the "deadliest."

Reaction
Reaction to the coverage has been swift and
substantive. Here's what has resulted so far:
• Brevard County legislators pledged
that I-95 safety would be their top prior-
ity during the 2001 legislative session. They
backed that pledge by setting a meeting in
January with the state secretary of trans-
portation to push for median barriers along
1-95 in Brevard County.

• The transportation secretary hired a
traffic engineering company to analyze
Brevard County's 73-mile stretch of I-95.
The company is expected to examine 10
years of crash records.

• The Metropolitan Planning Organi-
zation, the chief transportation planning
agency in Brevard, said it would use our
report to build a public awareness cam-
paign to improve safety on Brevard's stretch
of I-95.

• In South Florida, Broward County of-
ficials initiated a public awareness cam-
paign to alert drivers to the dangers of I-
95 in that county. Transportation officials
in Broward are continuing to study 1-95
crash records in an area the newspaper
identified as the stretch with the most fa-
tal wrecks and the most traffic.

• And state highway patrol officials are
using the newspaper's finding to lobby vig-
orously for more high-visibility enforce-
ment along the entire interstate, including
more marked and unmarked cars, increased
DUI enforcement and aircraft speed-en-
forcement details.

TRANSPORTATION
Truck safety

By Andy Lehren
Dateline NBC
During a lull at a truck inspection station
in rural Florida, I took a drive a few miles up
the road. It wouldn't take much guesswork
to figure out what I saw. Trucks. Lots of
trucks. Some pulled over the side of the road.
Others getting off at exits that had little dis-
cernible lure for commercial traffic.

They were doing whatever they could to
avoid inspections. They were driving down
tiny main streets, past scattered homes. They
trundled by schools and farms. You could
hear them speaking on CB radio about the
best way to navigate the back roads so they
could pop back on the interstate, past the
inspectors. Some would play possum by pull-
ing into a parking lot, waiting for the inspec-
tion station to close.

The reason we undertook
such a thorough
approach was to
overcome some of the
incompleteness and
unreliability that happen
if you relied solely on one
of these databases.

Welcome to one of the things you won't
see when you look at truck inspection data.
When trucks are inspected, one of five is
pulled out of service. A lot of the time it's
for brakes that won't work right when there's
an emergency; stuff that leads to accidents.
When you see trucks pulling off the road to
avoid inspections, you know there are a lot
of inspections that never happen. That one-
out-of-five figure is only a baseline.

Dateline NBC obtained more than a dozen
databases to examine the problems with
trucking safety. These included federal and
state databases on accidents, inspections,
truck carrier profiles, safety ratings and en-
forcement actions. The sources included the
U.S. Office of Motor Carriers (now called
the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Adminis-
tration), the National Transportation Safety
Board, the U.S. Bureau of Transportation
Statistics, and transportation and public
safety agencies in several states, including
Florida, Missouri, Texas and California.

The reason we undertook such a thorough
approach was to overcome some of the in-
completeness and unreliability that happen
if you relied solely on one of these databases.
The result allowed the news magazine to
more fully document the problems in truck-
ing safety, in a story produced by Lynn Keller
with correspondent Steve Daniels. It docu-
mented how many trucking companies sys-
tematically ignored safety rules and put bad
trucks on the road, and how regulators fall
short monitoring them.

Studies and reports
A starting point for our work was collect-
ing various reports and studies that had been
done on trucking safety, to establish sound
methodologies. It also helped us gauge how
well different states handle truck safety. Cali-
fornia, for instance, is much better than Ar-
kansas.

The simplest analysis was tracking which
companies had unusually high out of service
rates when their trucks were inspected. This
is where having state data becomes impor-
tant. Federal truck inspection data is only
required to include interstate carriers. One
in ten trucks on the road are intrastate truck-
ers. They aren't licensed to go into other
states. So their inspection records are not in-
cluded in federal databases – even if they are
part of a subsidiary that's an interstate car-
rier. These trucks tend to face less scrutiny.
It's also one of the things you won't see when
you check a company's history off the U.S.
Department of Transportation's web site
(www.safersys.org).

Some states offer far more details in their
inspection and accident data. Those addi-
tional columns of data may tell you more
about the driver or more easily identify a
particular truck. The federal Fatality Analy-
sis Reporting System is also good for double-
checking truck accident data.

Truck safety

Safety scores
Several of these databases were obtained
under the Freedom of Information Act and
state open records laws. The most significant
victory was a FOIA request that Dateline
NBC won, on appeal, with the U.S. Office
of Motor Carriers. We were the first news
organization to obtain a recently developed
database known as SafeStat, short for the
Motor Carrer Safety Status Measurement
System. It's worth getting, and should be easy
to obtain for any news organization seeking
it these days.

SafeStat includes numerical grades on the
safety of trucking companies. The scores are
on a sliding scale, and allow you to compare
different companies with scores for four ar-
eas: driver, vehicle, accident and safety man-
agement.

Dateline NBC used the FOIA to also ob-
tain the safety classifications kept by federal
regulators in a separate, older system, as part
of the federal motor carrier census. These are
three letter grades – satisfactory, conditional
and unsatisfactory.

Just like the statistics books tell you,
there's a lot of subtlety that's lost when data
is categorical. Out of service rates, accident
rates and SafeStat scores give you a much
better sense of how much safer one trucking
company is versus another. That sense of pro-
portion is lost when information is telescoped
into three grades.

But the older three-grade system is still
worth a look. The grades are one more way
to cross-check the different rates. It also gives
you a sense of a company's history. Very few
are unsatisfactory. But experts say that in this
somewhat lenient system, keep your eye on
trends. If a company is unable to maintain a
satisfactory grade consistently over the years
- say, it goes from unsatisfactory to satisfac-
tory to conditional and then again condi-
tional - it's worth checking out.

One way we used SPSS was to run a lin-
ear regression comparing the size of truck
companies versus their serious accident rate,
then comparing companies against like com-
petitors. Reporters should look for outliers -
which companies have higher than expected
accident rates. (There is much in the litera-
ture on using numbers of trucks versus miles
traveled, generally a less reliable number.
Reporters should be aware of these factors,
run the data both ways, and compare results).

Mapping
We used mapping software several ways.
Perhaps the most interesting was plotting
accident and inspection data to figure out
which inspection stations we wanted to visit,
to see how regulators handled their workload
and dealt with companies that had a pattern
of problems. That meant we were there when
a military munitions truck was pulled out of
service for not being safe to drive.

Mapping also helped us
analyze whether a
trucking company was
inspected more in certain
states, and whether those
states had lax or stringent
inspections.

Mapping also helped us analyze whether
a trucking company was inspected more in
certain states, and whether those states had
lax or stringent inspections. One large truck-
ing carrier, for instance, scored well in its
home state, and usually scored much worse
elsewhere in the country.

Having all this data allowed us to challenge
trucking industry claims about safety. We
knew which companies' paper records for on-
site inspections we wanted to obtain. Enforce-
ment data helped underscore the contrast be-
tween the problems on the roadways and the
declining actions taken by regulators.

The data also helped us make sure we had
a strong reason for highlighting the different
companies and accidents that were profiled
in the story.

FIRST VENTURE
Bus driver OT

By Dan Feldstein
Houston Chronicle
William "Bones" Pierson is a legend
among bus drivers at Houston's Metropoli-
tan Transit Authority.

He routinely drives 19-hour days and
seven-day weeks. He didn't take a day off
between Aug. 21 and Nov. 4.

He earned $109,000 last year, more than
tripling his base salary through overtime.
Dozens of other drivers were close behind.

I hadn't known about Bones or the oth-
ers until the computer tipped me off.

Fresh out of NICAR's January boot camp,
I wanted something simple and comfortable
for my first venture.

I ranked them in
descending order and
found my first real
problem: The top guy
drove 26 hours in one
day. Good trick.

I covered transportation before I went to
the Chronicle's projects desk, so I picked on
Metro - the Metropolitan Transit Author-
ity. I'd heard that some of its drivers were
racking up big bucks driving overtime.

I had four questions: How much were
they earning? How much were they driving?
Was this legal? Was this safe?

I requested the record layout of any data-
base that contained time records, pay records
or accident records. Neatly, they had all three.
Each was separate, but each had a field for
driver ID and a field for date. I requested
them all for the calendar year 2000, plus a
week on either end.

They came in Excel worksheets and I care-
fully put them into Access. The pay was
trickier than I had expected. There were
nearly a million records for only about 1,500
drivers because each type of pay was listed in
a different record. On any one day, a driver
could have one record for regular pay, one
for overtime pay, one for a monthly bonus,
etc.

Some simple SQL gave me a list of the
top earners.

List of adjustments
The time records were next. They came
by driver, by day. These were "platform min-
utes," the actual time the driver was on the
street, behind the wheel. I ranked them in
descending order and found my first real
problem: The top guy drove 26 hours in one
day. Good trick.

Oh yeah, said the Metro computer guy.
You need the "list of adjustments." Every bus
route has a set time. But if you get stuck in
traffic, time can be tacked on. And if you get
ill and leave early, time can be deducted. Plus
other errors are corrected.

It turned out there were roughly 50,000
adjustments for about 350,000 records,
which is when I learned about "outer joins."
Using driver ID and date, I tacked the ad-
justments onto my time table in a new field.
Then I summed that field with the original
time field in a query to create a new master
table.

It turns out the top shift was 21 hours
behind the wheel, not 26 — so much more
reasonable.

Checking the law
Was all this driving legal? The feds allow
interstate commercial drivers no more than
10 hours behind the wheel each day, or 60
hours in seven days. Texas allows intrastate
drivers 12 hours a day or 70 in seven days.
But both governments exempt government
drivers.

Still, 16 percent of all shifts driven by
Metro last year would have violated the fed-
eral safety standard, and 5 percent would have
violated the state standard.

For the single-day standard, it was easy to
calculate. How many records were over 10
hours, over 12 hours?

The seven-day rolling total was wicked,
however. It didn't exist, and I would have to
create it. On every given day, how many
hours had the driver been driving in the pre-
vious seven?

Bus driver OT

Help from NICAR-L
I turned to the NICAR listserv. Three
people offered suggestions. Tim Henderson
of The Miami Herald offered this:

SELECT a.driver_id, a.work_date,
sum(b.minutes) as rollingminutes
FROM Platform as a, Platform as b
WHERE ((([b].[driver_ID])=[a].[driver_ID])
and ((b.work_date) between ([a].[work_date]-7)
and ([a].[work_date]-1)))
GROUP BY a.driver_id, a.work_date

It worked! I also tweaked it slightly to get
the last six days plus the current day.

Finally came the question of whether the
excessive driving was more dangerous than
regular shifts. Experts said yes, but was there
statistical evidence?

Actually, it didn't show up in my crude
analysis. I joined the time and accident tables,
using driver ID and date. I found that, gen-
erally, the percentage of accidents attributed
to drivers who had exceeded drive-time stan-
dards was the same as the percentage of shifts
that were driven in excess of those standards.

Jumping into a project
immediately after boot
camp really solidified SQL
in my mind. It would have
escaped otherwise.

And frankly, it took me as long to refine
that statement into a single sentence as it
did to make the calculations.

Lessons learned
This story could be replicated in a lot of
cities. Transit systems have a tough time
making new hires because of drug tests and
a good economy. They are as happy with
overtime as the drivers are.

I learned several lessons in this project.
While the data looked nice and neat, there
were certainly some individual entries that
had errors. Some of the accidents simply
didn't join with the time table, for instance.
The buses weren't being driven by phan-
tom drivers - people had entered wrong
dates, wrong driver IDs, etc., into the data-
base.

I kept my analysis broad because of that.
And when I generated a list of the top 10
longest shifts that I was going to print, I
gave it to Metro to check. Sure enough, they
found a couple that were in error a guy
got sick, someone else hopped on his bus
and their times were merged, etc. But most
were correct.

SQL solidified
Other important things: Jumping into a
project immediately after boot camp really
solidified SQL in my mind. It would have
escaped otherwise.

Also, what little I know about databases
puts me one step ahead of most flaks. I made
my best progress by suggesting a conference
call among the flak, Metro's computer guy
and me. It helped enormously for the flak
to hear the computer guy say, "Oh that's
easy." It took two or three weeks to get the
data, free of charge.

"Bones" owns a nightclub and a Lexus
that he doesn't get to drive much. Sadly,
his wife told him to choose between mar-
riage and driving so much overtime.

The new bachelor still has his pedal to
the metal. And his picture was on the front
page as the reigning overtime king of Metro

The story was the talk of bus riders for
few days, but not much else has happened.
The transit authority has changed no poli-
cies, saying it doesn't see a safety problem.

The authority did embark on a major ad-
vertising campaign to attract more drivers.

Endnote: My second CAR project, just
completed, was with racial-profiling data at
the Houston Police Department. They an-
nounced grandly in August 1999 that they
were going to track all officer-initiated stops
whether a ticket was issued or not. The story
ended up being that the cops weren't both-
ering to fill out their profiling form.

TRANSPORTATION
Water, roads and more

By Devon Hammes
IRE and NICAR
If you are seeking out a topic for an in-
depth investigative piece, or if you just need
that nugget of information to follow up on
the most recent plane crash, transportation
data has you covered.

Story ideas abound in data such as haz-
ardous materials, boating accidents, truck
accidents or any of numerous aviation
datasets.

Readers of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram
learned where some of the most dangerous
routes in Texas were thanks to one reporter's
use of data.

Jeff Claassen used Microsoft FoxPro and
Excel to examine the dangers of driving on
Texas highways and interstates. The paper
specifically wanted to find where drivers in
north Texas and statewide were most likely
to encounter a bad accident.

With help from
transportation experts,
Claassen devised a
method to use average
daily traffic figures to
calculate a rate of serious
wrecks per volume of
traffic.

One thing to keep in mind when work-
ing on any story that relies on statistics is that
it is necessary to normalize the data. To nor-
malize his data, Claassen took into consider-
ation the number of vehicles travelling on a
specific roadway.

"Other newspapers had analyzed Texas
accident data, but focused on the total num-
ber of fatalities or fatal wrecks for each seg-
ment of a freeway or highway, called a 'con-
trol section," Claassen said. "That seemed
incomplete because the fact that one road-
way had more fatalities or fatal wrecks than
another could just be the result of having
more traffic. Also, the control sections var-
ied in length from as short as a mile to more
than 30 miles, making them difficult to com-
pare to each other."

With help from transportation experts,
Claasen devised a method to use average daily
traffic figures to calculate a rate of serious
wrecks per volume of traffic. He also broad-
ened the story by including serious injury
accidents.

The paper used accident report data from
the Department of Public Safety, which con-
sisted of about 1.9 million records from 1993
to October 1999 (the most recent available).
The Fort Worth Star-Telegram also obtained
the Road Inventory file from the Texas De-
partment of Transportation, which provided
average daily traffic figures for the roadway
"control sections."

But this is where some problems began.

"Our first roadblock was incomplete data.
The DPS data notes the location of some
accidents using 'control sections,' and oth-
ers using city accident-location codes. That
omitted important places like Houston and
San Antonio from the mix, so we requested
more data to fill in the holes," he said.

Claassen then focused the investigation
by analyzing wrecks from January 1997 to
October 1997 to give the study more accu-
racy. Transportation analysts told him that
time frame was an accurate look at the aver-
age number of accidents. State officials
warned Claassen that the distance of control
sections sometimes change. So, with help
from the transportation institute, he was able
to develop a method to calculate the rate of
serious injury and fatal wrecks.

Cable cars
Even if a story doesn't start from the data,
transportation stories can be found anywhere
in the city. For example, Dan Noyes of KGO-
TV in San Francisco took an in-depth look
at cable car safety. The story found that the
cable cars are not as safe as many people
might think.

"I decided to look into the cable car story
after seeing several accidents over the
months," Noyes said. "I wondered how this
piece of San Francisco history compared to

Water, roads

other forms of transportation."
Using accident reports from the Califor-
nia Highway Patrol, Noyes was able to put
together a spreadsheet in Excel. With that
spreadsheet, he analyzed how many accidents
occur per million passenger miles traveled for
the different modes of transportation car,
light rail, bus and cable car. The biggest prob-
lem KGO-TV had was getting authorities to
realize that his station had a right to the in-
formation.

Boating accidents
Karl Ebert of The Northwestern in
Oshkosh, Wis., used the federal Recreational
Boating Accidents Database to look at the
number of boating accidents on Wisconsin
waters. He found several instances of acci-
dents that were attributed to alcohol and the
boater's inexperience in maneuvering the
vessel.

"People up here love three things: booze,
boats and speed. Each summer we report sto-
ries about boat accidents, most of them
brought on by bad behavior of one sort or
another, and decided that we needed to look
into the issue to see just how big a problem
there actually is out on the water," he said.

The data did help give the story more ac-
curacy, but Ebert ran into a few problems
along the way.

"The biggest problems were the inability
and in some cases unwillingness of county
officials and local wardens to provide infor-
mation about tickets that had been written
on the water. Because of time and publica-
tion scheduling constraints we decided to go
with more anecdotal information. That was
frustrating, but I don't think it hurt the main
thrust of the story," Ebert said.

There were also instances in which he
found some problems in the data itself. There
was a change in the data's format from sev-
eral years ago, and because of that, not all of
the fields matched up. He also found that a
field indicating alcohol involvement was
unreliable in historical data because it hadn't
been consistently reported.

FIRST VENTURE
Outside the gates

By Brian D. Crecente
Rocky Mountain News
Editor's Note: Crecente was a reporter with
the Palm Beach Post when he wrote the
Atlantis story.

A year of investigation, database entry
and query building boiled down to just two
numbers: 1,067 and 99.3.

But those numbers made the story.

The Palm Beach Post found that in 1997
and 1998, the tiny gated city of Atlantis qui-
etly took control of three major roads fram-
ing its boundaries and began churning out
tickets to nearly everyone but its own resi-
dents.

In one year's time, 99.3 percent of all
tickets written by city police went to out-
of-town drivers.

In the past five years, Atlantis fine col-
lections jumped from about $5,400 to more
than $63,000 - a 1,067 percent increase.

I knew we were on to
something, but I had no
idea how dramatic the
numbers were going to
be until I ran my first
query.

Despite Florida's wonderful sunshine
laws, getting to those numbers wasn't as easy
as it could have been. The story began as
we followed a tip from a disgruntled ex-
Atlantis cop who alleged tickets were being
issued on racial lines. We later found that
not to be the case.

My colleague, Matt Mossman, made
dozens of requests for traffic ticket data from
the city, but officials said tickets weren't
tracked and that there weren't any electronic
records. Finally we went to the source, the
Atlantis police chief, and requested copies
of all traffic citations and warnings issued
by the department from July 1998 to June
1999. The result of the request came in four
large boxes, 1,506 tickets sorted by date and
several hundred warnings.

Construction
Database editor Christine Stapleton con-
structed a database in Access which included
fields for everything from the officer's badge
number to the specifics of the citation and
when and where it was issued.

Mossman spent the next few months en-
tering the data and then as his data entry
drew to a close, left the paper.

I was left with the enviable task of sort-
ing through a well-organized database, filled
with the sort of numbers investigative re-
porters dream about. There were about
2,000 records between Access and Excel
tables.

I knew we were on to something, but I
had no idea how dramatic the numbers were
going to be until I ran my first query.

Digging in
After a little fiddling around, I typed a
query that would show how many of the
tickets issued were to people whose driver's
license showed them living anywhere but
Atlantis.

Of the 1,506 tickets analyzed, only 11
went to residents. The other 99.3 percent
went to non-residents.

We had our story.

The database also showed that the city's
police seemed to spend a majority of their
time outside the walls of their city, with all
but 60 of the tickets written being for traf-
fic stops on the three main roads framing
the city's walls.

Atlantis residents were also more likely
to receive warnings than tickets when pulled
over. About 78 percent of the Atlantis resi-
dents who where pulled over received warn-
ings, while only 16 percent of the out-of-
towners pulled over received warnings.

It was important not to stop with just
the data we collected on speeding tickets. I
also needed to understand how the city was
able to annex the three roads that framed
the city's walls.

After nearly a month of talking to city,
county and state officials, I discovered that
the county and the state either didn't offi-

cially allow the annexations or didn't fully
understand what the annexations meant.

According to city records, Atlantis didn't
have to do anything on the three newly-an-
nexed streets, but write tickets.

The county commissioner, after hearing
this, quickly launched an investigation into
the annexation and the city's policy of writ-
ing tickets outside of their city but not work-
ing crashes on those same streets.

Crashes
Next I went to the Palm Beach County
traffic division to collect data on the num-
ber of crashes that occurred on the streets
annexed by Atlantis.

The spreadsheet showed
that while Atlantis police
spent a lot of time
patrolling the streets for
speeders, they hardly
ever worked the crashes
that occurred there.

Again, while I found the officials all too
willing to comply with the sunshine law, the
data was not in an electronic form. I found
myself thumbing through oversized note-
books copying the data into my notepad,
which I later transferred to Excel.

The spreadsheet showed that while
Atlantis police spent a lot of time patrol-
ling the streets for speeders, they hardly ever
worked crashes that occurred there. Of the
733 crashes that occurred on those three
roadways from 1996 to March 2000,
Atlantis police worked three, but none of
the five fatal ones.

In an interview, the police chief didn't
admit to the over-enforcement, but simply
said his residents didn't speed. He added
that the department's written policy stated
officers are supposed to spend only 30 min-
utes per eight-hour shift parked outside the
city walls. He also said that the reason for
the city's enforcement was because they
wanted to reduce crashes and that cars pass-
ing his city were not only speeding they were
going well over the limit.

After getting back to the office, I ran a
few quick queries to check out the chief's
answers.

Chief's answers
I found that despite the increased traffic
enforcement in the area, crashes along the
three roads went up about 15 percent while
the amount of traffic in that area went up
by only 9 percent.

I also found at least four officers who
broke the 30-minute rule, showing up in
the database for writing tickets over as much
as a five-hour period.

I set up another interview with the chief.
When I told him what I found he said
that his officers had gotten so over-zealous
in their pursuit of traffic tickets he had to
issue a moratorium on writing tickets.

He also said that inside the city's limits
police follow a policy that allows officers to
ticket someone going only 5 to 9 mph over
the limit, if they have received a prior warn-
ing.

Luckily, we had created a separate Ac-
cess database of all of the warnings issued
over the year, so when I got back to the of-
fice I ran a query for all tickets issued inside
the city to people traveling less then 10 mph
over the limit and then ran that list against
our database of warnings.

I found 14 occasions where officers tick-
eted drivers who were traveling 9 mph over
the speed limit but had no prior warning.

Again I met with the chief. He said that
11 of the 14 tickets were written by two of-
ficers who are no longer with the depart-
ment and that the problems were anoma-
lies.

The end result of the data entry, queries,
spreadsheets, and back-and-forth interviews
was a two-story package that outraged readers
and lead to the county commissioner re-evalu-
ating the county's annexation procedures.

TRANSPORTATION
Tread dangers

By David Raziq, Anna Werner, and
Chris Henao
KHOU-TV, Houston
The story began with a simple conversa-
tion: a lawyer told us of a fatal accident in-
volving something called "tread separation."
In this case, he claimed a woman was driv-
ing her Ford Explorer down a Texas high-
way when suddenly one of the car's tires, a
Firestone Radial ATX, simply lost its tread.
At that point, it was just a tip, but we de-
cided to look into it further. Additional con-
tacts with attorneys and others revealed
more cases involving the same tire and car
combination: Firestone ATX tires and Ford
Explorers.

Obviously, our curiosity was piqued:
How big was the problem? We found that
some traditional resources didn't provide the
answer. For example, the government's Fa-
tality Analysis Reporting System database
did not list tire brands or makes. And the
tire manufacturers, who collected tire return
and failure claim data considered that in-
formation to be "proprietary." (Although
such information was often turned over to
plaintiffs' attorneys during lawsuits, it might
be protected by court order.)

Paper trail
So we gathered our own data by using,
among other documents, court records and
accident reports. We also interviewed a
number of experts who were in a hands-on
position to know what the industry's data
on these tires might be like.

We knew the limits of our approach and
our data wouldn't allow for any kind of sta-
tistical analysis, but we decided that that was
not our goal in any event. In the first place,
any real "answers" about the allegations
would only be obtained through an objec-
tive and scientific analysis of both a full body
of the industry's data along with a mechani-
cal investigation of both the tire types and
perhaps even the SUV model.

Therefore, the point of our story was that
there clearly seemed to be enough allega-
tions to warrant an in-depth investigative
broadcast asking whether or not there was
a problem and to bring it to the attention
of Firestone, Ford, the appropriate govern-
ment officials, and the public itself. If that
happened, then perhaps it would lead to an
open and scientific look at the issue.

We went to work and soon sat down to
discuss the cases we had accumulated at
the time, more than two dozen deaths that
victims' families claimed allegedly resulted
from tread separations on Firestone ATX
tires mounted on Ford Explorers.

A spokesperson for The National High-
way Traffic Safety Administration told us
agency officials were unaware of any pat-
tern of accidents involving the tire and SUV,
despite the dozens of complaints from Ford
Explorer owners we had found on the
agency's own Web site. (Although many of
those complaints did not identify a specific
model or even make of tire, by this time we
knew that the Radial ATX had been origi-
nal equipment on thousands of Explorers
and many of the complaints appeared to be
about tread separations.)

Our findings were further supported in
the first story, Feb. 7, 2000, by a former em-
ployee of Firestone's North Carolina tire
plant, who told us about what he felt were
quality control problems at the plant.

Results
Three nights later, as we were about to
air a follow-up report, the president of our
corporation received a multi-page letter
from Firestone disputing our story. The let-
ter called our report "misleading."

The letter also called our story unbal-
anced and stated "the broadcast may be
grounds for finding of actual malice." We
included the company's response in our Feb-
ruary 10 story, reporting their most dam-
aging allegations in the interests of fairness.
We also posted the full letter on our Web
site for viewers to read.

However, we continued to investigate,
eventually learning that NHTSA was do-
ing its own internal investigation of com-
plaints reported by our viewers to the
agency. By May, the agency announced it
was beginning a defect investigation into the
Firestone ATX, ATX2, and Wilderness AT
tires.

As we monitored the investigation, there
was another break in the story. On July 30,

Tread dangers

a source called to let us know that since late
May, Ford had been recalling ATX and Wil-
derness tires from Ford Explorers in Ven-
ezuela because of accidents similar to ones
in the U.S. We even found out that Ford
was planning to include similar recalls in
Ecuador and Columbia. Within days, the
national media jumped on board and cov-
erage of the issue became widespread. Fi-
nally, just weeks later Firestone made the
announcement it would voluntarily recall
more than six million ATX, ATX II, and
Wilderness AT tires.

Obviously the story didn't stop there. We
also broke the story that Venezuela was con-
sidering criminal charges against both Ford
and Firestone. And, of course, events here
eventually led to congressional hearings, and
the recent passage of a new law that among
other things sets criminal penalties for
manufacturers who don't address defects
and forces them to tell the federal govern-
ment when they recall products in other
countries.

Firestone

The analysis was based on the Fatality
Analysis Reporting System of the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This
is the main source for much of what we know
about fatal accidents and has documented an
extraordinary increase in auto safety and de-
crease in fatal accidents over the last decades.

The database is based on accident inves-
tigation data compiled from police accident
investigators across the country, and includes
information on various factors, from the
weather, to road conditions, speed, alcohol
use, and mechanical and driver problems that
the investigators concluded might have con-
tributed to the accident.

This was remarkable
(some may say debatable)
because reports of tire-
related deaths were rare
events.

This was remarkable (some may say de-
batable) because reports of tire-related deaths
were rare events.

I opened up the online documentation
in Microsoft Word and searched for the word
"tire" and then "rollover" and I was on my
way. The FARS dataset is one of those
Internet wonders. Getting it once required
weeks of work on the mainframe. You can
now download the manual and the data in
minutes. And it was available as both a text
file and as a SAS file that I was able to load
into SPSS with little effort. [FARS is also
available from NICAR] There is even an
online query system you can try out on your
own at http://www.fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/www/
query.html.

Trouble spots
But as I spent more time with the data, I
realized that the results were not quite right
and wouldn't be until we solved a series of
technical and reporting problems. We at first
used the coding for vehicle type we found in
the federal database and immediately discov-
ered a problem. Since the Ford Explorer was
the successor to the Bronco II (which became
notorious because of rollover problems in the
1980's), the FARs people used the same cod-
ing for both vehicles.

That's where the extraordinary resources
at The Times began to make a difference.
Keith Bradsher, our guy in Detroit, said, no,
no, no, you can't combine the Explorers,
which began to appear in 1991, with the
older Bronco. Older vehicles tend to have
more fatal accidents (especially the Bronco
II) and Ford's own safety data compares the
Explorers to other vehicles in use since 1991.

So we followed Ford's own methodology
and our first problem was solved.

The next problem was how to account for
the fact that accidents are related to how
many vehicles are on the road. The more cars
on the road, the more accidents. We needed
to standardize the information by comput-
ing some kind of rate.

It turned out that all the information
about how many vehicles were on the road
were owned by a private data company, The
Polk Company. The people at Polk were very
helpful in providing some dollops of data to
us, but when we first asked for lots of year-
by-year data, we had a problem. (You can
probably get use of their entire dataset for
under $100,000).

Instead, we borrowed some techniques
used in medical research and did what the
epidemiologists call a retrospective study.
Instead of asking what percent of cars on the
road had tire accidents, we looked backwards
and figured out what proportion of fatal ac-
cidents were caused by tires, and then we
compared the experience of Ford Explorers
to all sport utility vehicles.

Finding the story
The results: Explorers involved in fatal
accidents were nearly three times as likely to
have tire problems as other vehicles. The
numbers were small, though were statistically
significant, and the trend was clear.

Though the database did not identify tire
brand, we used the vehicle coding in the da-
tabase to identify the two plants used to pro-
duce Ford Explorers in the mid-1990s. We
showed that Explorers produced at plants that

installed Firestone tires had far more acci-
dents than Explorers produced at the other
plant.

But what did it mean. We already knew
that Explorers had a problem. So what was
new? Stephen Engelberg, the new Investiga-
tions editor at The Times, was relentless and
convincing in arguing that the government
and the auto industry should have, or at least
could have, been monitoring the data and
been aware that something was amiss at least
by 1998.

Working with Matt Wald in Washington,
we put together the story on deadline. We
were refining definitions and rerunning tables
and graphics up until the evening.

The next morning, I went back to the FARS
Web site and was stunned to discover that in
the few days I had spent working on Ford Ex-
plorers, the agency had released another year of
data. I reran my programming in SPSS against
the new data and found that there was a surge
in tire-related accidents in 1999, more than in
all previous years combined.

This was a clear indicator to me that the
number of Ford Explorer-Firestone tire com-
plaints was certain to rise in the coming
months. But my editors were skeptical, so
we made an extraordinary effort to verify that
the Explorer accidents actually involved
Firestone tires.

We matched the list against the list of fa-
tal tire complaints, and in other cases tracked
down accident reports, and in some cases the
state troopers or local police who filed them
to determine whether the accidents involved
Firestone tires. In some cases, officers pulled
out accident photos and looked for the name
of the tire with a magnifying glass.

We reported that the complaint death toll
was likely to rise, and the death count has in
fact risen several times since then. So never
duck when someone asks you to help open a
spreadsheet.

AUTO ACCIDENTS
Crash scams

By Fred Schulte and Jenni Bergal
South Florida Sun-Sentinel
Just about everybody in the auto insur-
ance business in Florida has a story about
fraud, from rings that stage fake accidents to
crash-care clinics that bill huge sums for need-
less treatments.

Unfortunately, most insurance companies
are wary of talking to the media. They don't
want to discuss fraud schemes for fear of
drawing a slander suit from those involved,
or out of concern that doing so would reveal
how vulnerable they are to cheaters. But a
number of public records exist to help re-
porters get an inside look at this multibillion
dollar criminal enterprise that investigators
say operates in some form in nearly every
state.

Our seven-month
investigation identified
more than 4,000 Florida
residents who played
roles in at least 1,400
suspicious auto accidents
statewide during the
1990s.

In "Crashing For Cash," a four-part se-
ries published in December, we exposed an
underworld of traffic accident stagers, cor-
rupt chiropractors and pain clinic owners,
ambulance chasing lawyers, patient solicitors
and medical testing brokers who band to-
gether to cheat insurance companies and con-
sumers.

Under Florida law, a doctor or clinic can
bill up to $10,000 for every crash patient
treated. Lawyers can tap insurers for thou-
sands of dollars more in personal injury settle-
ments. This fast money drives the industry.
Our seven-month investigation identified
more than 4,000 Florida residents who
played roles in at least 1,400 suspicious auto
accidents statewide during the 1990s.

Hundreds of them were chiropractors or
lay owners of crash clinics who had been re-
ported to state fraud investigators for pad-
ding bills or running needless medical tests
on uninjured accident victims.

Others belonged to crash rings, whose
members often were related by blood,
ethnicity or neighborhood ties. We entered
each name we encountered into one of seven
Microsoft Access databases that allowed us
to keep a running total of crash-for-cash par-
ticipants.

Data sources
Here are some of the primary sources we
used:
• State Department of Insurance files. To
our surprise, the Florida Division of Insur-
ance Fraud allowed us to visit five of their
offices around the state, where we inspected
more than 500 closed cases, dating to 1995.
Most had been closed without an arrest.

Patterns quickly emerged.
Dozens of chiropractors and clinics alleg-
edly were paying "runners" to recruit pa-
tients, sometimes offering them $300 to
$600 apiece, for instance.

In other cases, solicitors obtained the
names of people in minor accidents by pur-
chasing crash reports in bulk at local police
stations and calling them at home with prom-
ises that they could make thousands of dol-
lars by claiming injuries in a lawsuit.

In addition, some people had obtained
drivers licenses under several aliases. We de-
cided to check their driving backgrounds.

• Department of Highway Safety & Mo-
tor Vehicles. We accessed driving histories
and accident records for people investigated
for insurance fraud, accident staging or pos-
sessing a phony drivers license, the criminal
charge that often gets filed against accident
stagers.

We entered this information into a data-
base, which included the name of the driver
and passengers in the accident, the speed at
impact, damage amount and age of the other
driver.

The data showed us that the same drivers
were involved in questionable crashes over

Continued from page sixteen:
Crash scams

and over. Some were members of the same
family. Some targeted elderly drivers as vic-
tims.

One man with six aliases was in three
dozen crashes. Eight people living in Palm
Beach County wracked up 139 crashes. One
family-based ring showed up in 68 suspi-
cious crashes.

We used standard industry criteria for de-
termining whether a crash was suspicious.
For instance, often the accident was little
more than a fender bender and the estimated
damage to the vehicles was under $500. Yet
the accident stager and his passengers would
immediately go to a chiropractor's office and
begin a series of expensive treatments.

In reaction to the series,
Florida lawmakers are
expected to take up a
number of legislative
fixes, including one that
would regulate auto
accident clinics and limit
their ownership to
medical professionals

Many other crashes in our sample oc-
curred in parking lots at about 5 miles per
hour.

• Civil court files. Increasingly, auto in-
surers are refusing to pay bills they believe
are inflated or bogus and are pressing their
cases in court. Records of these civil law-
suits, especially depositions of doctors and
clinic owners, are invaluable, both for lo-
cating patients and establishing question-
able billing practices and medical testing
abuses.

Other court cases can be helpful as well.
Insurers in some states, for instance, have
filed class action suits against chiropractors
and clinics, claiming they have deliberately
inflated costs or billed for services that
weren't rendered. Some of the biggest cases
have been filed in Chicago and New Jersey.

• Disciplinary and criminal case files. We
obtained a list of all Florida Board of Chi-
ropractic Medicine disciplinary cases in the
last five years and requested hard copies of
cases that involved insurance fraud or pa-
tient solicitation, including penalties im-
posed.

More work
We combined those named in disciplin-
ary cases with other chiropractors, doctors
and clinics whose names surfaced in state
insurance fraud complaints, arrest records
or civil court cases for suspected accident
fraud.

This list grew to more than 60 medical
clinics in Miami-Dade County alone and
more than 400 chiropractors, many of them
reported to the state repeatedly for accident
fraud.

We also examined the applications of chi-
ropractors with criminal histories and found
that the board had granted licenses to doz-
ens of chiropractors from other states with
criminal convictions including insurance
fraud and cocaine trafficking.

Checking the criminal histories of acci-
dent clinic operators, we also found a num-
ber of owners with felony convictions, in-
cluding ex-drug dealers who had migrated
to the crash treatment racket.

In reaction to the series, Florida lawmak-
ers are expected to take up a number of leg-
islative fixes, including one that would regu-
late auto accident clinics and limit their
ownership to medical professionals.

Other proposals include increasing
criminal penalties for insurance fraud and
accident staging and cracking down on run-
ners who exploit crash victims on behalf of
doctors and lawyers.

Judging from the early reaction among
state officials, we're glad we told this story.

USING THE WEB
Body parts industry

By Ronald Campbell
The Orange County Register
When a team of reporters began work in
October 1999 on the story that became "The
Body Brokers," we started with a vague idea:
People were buying and selling body parts
donated at death. CAR played an important
role in uncovering the dimensions and prac-
tices of the $500 million body parts indus-
try.

Among the findings of the five-part se-
ries: Nonprofit tissue banks work hand-in-
glove with for-profit processors, often
through exclusive contracts; the pressure to
get more bodies is so strong that tissue bank
employees and researchers occasionally take
body parts without asking; and although the
Food and Drug Administration and the in-
dustry claim a near-perfect safety record for
tissue products, they aren't looking very hard.

Although we explored many issues in our
story - legal, political, even moral and reli-
gious issues -The Body Brokers was at heart
a business story. Like any business, tissue
banks and processors had to find raw mate-
rial, win financial backing, develop technol-
ogy, deal with pesky bureaucrats and market
their products. Those universal business
needs created paper and online trails.

Nonprofits
We were dealing with the intersection of
nonprofit groups and for-profit, often pub-
lic corporations. As a result, we often could
get information from corporate documents
that was unavailable from the nonprofits, and
vice-versa. For example, we learned early in
our investigation that the American Red
Cross was among the nation's largest tissue
suppliers. We knew it had a relationship with
Osteotech, a New Jersey-based public com-
pany. The Red Cross wouldn't give us a copy
of its contract with Osteotech. But Osteotech
had included the contract in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. It took
just a few minutes to find the contract on
EDGAR, the SEC's irreplaceable online da-
tabase of corporate documents (www.sec.gov).

(A hint for those seeking obscure coгpo-
rate documents: Read the footnotes at the
end of a company's 10-Kor 10-Q. These will
list not only documents attached to the cur-
rent filing but citations to documents that
were filed years ago, including the name and
date of the relevant filing. A recent Osteotech
filing pointed us to a 2- or 3-year-old filing
that contained the American Red Cross con-
tract.)

When we began our research, Guidestar
(www.guidestar.org) – a wonderful source for
reporters on the nonprofit beat - had just
begun posting Form 990's for hundreds of
thousands of nonprofits. We had to get our
990s the old fashioned way, through a mas-
sive request to the Internal Revenue Service.

CAR played an important
role in uncovering the
dimensions and practices
of the $500 million body
parts industry.

Once we got sufficient 990s and 10-K's,
we assembled them into a series of spread-
sheets. Although this information was a year
to 18 months out of date, it gave us an excel-
lent idea of the industries' finances and of
the nonprofit/for-profit relationships that
made everything work. This put us in a strong
position when we interviewed industry ex-
ecutives; we knew too much to be given the
standard industry spin on the "gift of life."

Federal regulation
The Food and Drug Administration was
an indifferent regulator of the industry. But
its Web site (www.fda.gov) still provided
many valuable clues. I strongly recommend
the agency's weekly online bulletin, which
lists every FDA-sanctioned recall. Its online
list of warning letters also is valuable. After
discovering that a simple search on "human
tissue" or "bone" missed many relevant re-
calls, I settled down to spend a day and a
half reading every FDA bulletin from the
beginning of 1994 (shortly after FDA began
regulating tissue banks) through the end of
1999. This provided the starting point for
our story on FDA's half-hearted enforcement

HEALTH CARE
Medical conflicts

By David Heath
The Seattle Times
Once officials at the Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center figured out that
we were working on a story that might
not be flattering, they became quite se-
cretive.

We wanted to know more about finan-
cial conflicts of interest in experimental
trials, yet they flatly refused to give us any
information about the financial holdings
of top researchers or even the center it-
self. The fact that some of these doctors
had financial entanglements with the
treatments they were researching - or that
patients died from these treatments
didn't sway them at all.

The state open records act was useless
because the Hutch is a private institution,
even though nearly 70 percent of its fund-
ing comes from federal grants. And an in-
triguing amendment to the federal Free-
dom of Information Act one intended
to open records on projects funded with
government grants was rendered worth-
less as well when research lobbyists pre-
vailed in getting new regulations that se-
verely undercut the law.

We seemed to be stuck.

With a little bit of
computer programming,
reading through those
documents could be
automated.

Unfortunately, there are no off-the-
shelf databases on physicians' financial
holdings. We knew that there was a lot of
information to be gleaned from Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission records,
patent records and the like, but we faced
the nightmare scenario of reading through
thousands - perhaps hundreds of thou-
sands - of pages looking for names.

Then it hit us. With a little bit of com-
puter programming, reading through
those documents could be automated.

It wouldn't be as easy as joining the
sex-offender database to the day-care
worker database. But with the wealth of
data easily accessible on the Internet and
the sophisticated tools we have available
today, it was clearly doable.

The results appear as part of our five-
part series, "Uninformed Consent: What
patients at the Hutch weren't told about
the experiments in which they died." The
series, written by Duff Wilson and my-
self and edited by David Boardman, docu-
ments two failed clinical trials in which
doctors had financial interests and in
which patients died from risky treatments
without being properly informed of the
risks.

To get information about financial
conflicts, first we needed researchers'
names. Then we would search for those
names in a slew of financial documents
from the SEC, an insider-trading database
and the U.S. patents full-text database.
We'd finally add our results to the few fi-
nancial disclosure forms that we were able
to obtain.

How we did it:
First we headed to the library to gather
up every biennial scientific report the
Hutch has ever published. These included
the names of their entire faculty, includ-
ing post-doctoral fellows. We sent photo-
copies to a vendor to be keyed into a da-
tabase. That was the easy part.

Next we tackled SEC documents.
Those are free through the Edgar data-
base at www.sec.gov. But we had two prob-
lems: How do we download all documents
for companies involved in the health-care
industry? And how do we search those
documents for names?

The answer to the download problem
was to write a program in Visual Basic. If
I ever doubted the value of learning a bit
of programming to do CAR work, this ex-
perience resolved those doubts. VB in-
cludes functions that allow you to go out
onto the Web and grab files. Other lan-
guages do too.

It took me two solid days to write the

Medical

program in one of those work binges
where you forget if it's almost dawn. But
the payoff was running the thing and ac-
tually seeing it work. I annoyed my wife
and plenty of friends by showing off the
finished product.

The list of all health-care companies
came from Edgar's own documentation
pages. Using my program, I grabbed ev-
ery annual report and proxy statement
for all years and put them into one mas-
sive text file.

The next problem was what to do with
this massive file. I could have written an-
other Visual Basic program to search for
each researcher's name in the file, but
that would have been deadly slow. What
I really needed was a text-indexing tool
to make the search speedy. My first
thought was to use Lotus Notes but I was
lucky to have a tool called Texis, a docu-
ment retrieval database that we use at the
Seattle Times for our own electronic clips
library.

This project is a good
example of the
seamless blending of
CAR work with
investigative reporting.

I won't bore you with the details here.
I'll just say that Texis is extremely pow-
erful and fast. Best of all it's a relational
SQL database that can do joins. So once
I got the text file loaded, parsed by com-
pany name, document type, year and the
full text of each document, I could run a
fairly simple join with the researchers'
names. The query would search each
document's full text looking for name
matches, like an automated clip search.
We searched for 1,800 names.

I had a big assist on this from research
editor Tom Boyer, who developed our
electronic library. For more information
on Texis, go to www.thunderstone.com.
The result of the query was a new file
with a large chunk of text on either side
of a name match. I loaded that dataset
into SQL Server and then started the
manual process of verifying each match.
With a few exceptions, this was easier
than it sounds because typically the
Hutch would be mentioned somewhere
in the text.

Patents
The next challenge was to get all pat-
ents by these researchers. The data are
available for free at www.uspto.gov/patft/
index.html. Again, a modification of the
Visual Basic program allowed me to grab
off the Web all patents in which Hutch
researchers were listed as inventors. I lim-
ited this search to inventors from the
state of Washington, which helped to
produce more clean matches.

Again, I had to weed out false hits
manually. If the person invented a new
type of typewriter ribbon or garden tool,
I automatically eliminated that patent.
However, a patent for radiation delivery
to lymphoid and marrow tissues was a
good candidate for a true hit. Finding
true matches wasn't terribly difficult.

We searched an insider-trading data-
base with the help of a company called
First Call, www.firstcall.com

One last piece came from investiga-
tive reporter Deborah Nelson, who un-
earthed these stories but left for The
Washington Post before she could com-
plete the project. She had requested all
financial disclosure forms for medical
faculty at the University of Washington
who also had positions at the Hutch.
That information - useful but incom-
plete was then keyed into a database.

All of these data were loaded into SQL
Server. I developed an interface in Ac-
cess to pull all the data we had on each
researcher together on one page. We cre-
ated an 'A' list of the researchers that we

other financial connections, we were able
to key these in manually through the

A quick note: to add researchers to the
'A' list later, I used an incredible tool in
SQL Server called triggers. FoxPro has the
same capa-
bility. The
trigger
would au-
tomatically
launch a
stored pro-
cedure to
create a
unique ID
for any
name we
added to
the 'A' list
and then
automati-
cally search
all datasets
and add
that unique
ID to other
tables to al-
low for
joins. In short, you type in a name and sud-
denly all the data about that person magi-
cally appears.

Triggers may be routine for database de-
velopers, but I'd never heard of them be-
ing used by CAR folks. I was awestruck by
them and encourage you to investigate.

Medline
In the course of our reporting, we also
downloaded abstracts of medical journal
articles written by Hutch researchers in the
past decade. These data are available
through a National Institutes of Health site
called Medline, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
pubmed/

Downloading them involved a total of
about 18,000 searches. My original pro-
gram ran as fast as possible, and I hadn't
really thought about the demand that this
would put on NIH servers until the an-
noyed database administrator blocked our
access. I called to let him know what we
were doing and he gave us access again pro-
viding we spaced our searches five seconds
apart and ran the program after 9 p.m.

We pulled full copies of articles for re-
searchers with financial interests the old-
fashioned way, photocopying them at a
medical library. This effort produced a
mere paragraph in our series about how re-
searchers don't disclose their interests in
medical journals, even when the articles are
about their patents.

We also made heavy use of our death
certificate database in tracking down pa-
tients. Other data included all grants from
the NIH and all clinical trials ever adver-
tised by the Hutch on the National Can-
cer Institutes' Web site.

After doing the CAR work, I assumed a
more traditional role of a shoe-leather re-
porter on the series. This project is a good
example of the seamless blending of CAR
work with investigative reporting. Even
though the series was aided by the most
sophisticated data work I've ever done, the
focus was not on data but on the compel-
ling stories of the patients, their families,
a whistleblower, a financier, a Nobel Prize
winner and the Hutch's doctors.

CENSUS 2000
Preparation pays off

By Robert Gebeloff
The Star-Ledger
Let's be frank- the 2000 Census is a four-
alarm headache.

There's a mountain of data to climb, and
at the summit sits some of the most nonde-
script field names in the history of data pro-
cessing.

Quick - how many P0010005s did you
have in your state? And what did they call
P001005 in 1990 and 1980? Then there's
the matter of mapping. Learning how to use
the canned maps that come with ArcView is
no easy feat. But learning how to convert Ti-
ger maps and tie them to the Census data
that's an entirely new skill.

And then there's the none-too-small mat-
ter of journalism - You've conquered the data,
now what's the story? Can you transform this
mountain of information into news, news that
would qualify as left(news,3), rather than a re-
hash of trends you've already reported to death?

Be prepared
All of this requires preparation - the Cen-
sus is just too big to do well on deadline.

At The Star-Ledger, we took all the stan-
dard measures. We sent people to IRE Cen-
sus seminars, we acquired and processed his
torical data, we did battle with the Tiger
Maps, and we devised and revised our list of
stories, graphics and maps throughout the
weeks leading up to C-Day. But we also made
a major investment in what I'll call logistical
preparation. We cover the state and compete
in eight local markets as well.

On Census release day, we would need to
get data that was cleaned and analyzed to our
bureaus in Washington and Trenton, not to
mention Woodbridge, West Caldwell, and
Morristown - on deadline.

What we came up with was a somewhat
Rube Goldberg-esque system of Access tables,
SQL Server Views and intranet Active Server
Pages. The idea was that the data would ar-
rive on Census day, a button would be
pushed, and poof - the 2000 numbers would
flow into place, fuel for thousands of pre-
programmed calculations.

Smooth sailing
I expected, of course, that the system
would cough and wheeze a few times along
the way, but to my amazement, it worked
without a hitch, and enabled us to execute
our coverage plan pretty much to the letter.
The New Jersey files arrived on my hard drive
at about 3:15 p.m. on a Thursday afternoon.
By the time the last edition was hitting the
presses, we had managed to get seven stories
in the paper, illustrated by four photos, five
maps, and 15 charts. The stuff was flowing
through production so fast that in one early
edition, a map got printed twice, but other-
wise, the paper came out looking like it was
the result of a month-long project. And then
we were well positioned to come back Sun-
day with more.

All of this requires
preparation - the Census
is just too big to do well
on deadline.

I mention quantity, but having prepared
was a matter of quality too. For example, we
got the 1990 PL 94-171 data and went to
the voting precinct level to generate demo-
graphics for the current state legislative
districts. Then we coded each district based
on the make-up of the three-member del-
egation. This enabled us to do precision re-
porting on political shifts.

While the competition noted generally
that population growth appeared to be greater
in Republican-controlled districts, we re-
ported precisely that 422,000 of the state's
684,000 population increase occurred in dis-
tricts with all-Republican representation.

Showing growth
Same idea with sprawl. It was obvious by
looking at county numbers that the growth
in New Jersey was occurring in places that
were mostly rural and suburban. But why
approximate? We got a list of Urban/Rural/
Suburban town classifications as labeled by
the state planning department. We simply
tied that list to the Census data and voila -
we were able to say precisely that the popu-

Census Lessons:

We'd like to hear from those
of you who had interesting
experiences in working with
the PL94 Census Data that
was released in March.

Are there lessons you learned
that would be beneficial to
others?

If this was your first experience
with Census data, was there
something you wished you had
known earlier?

Did your news organization
come up with a unique story
based on the data?

We'd like you to share your
experiences in an upcoming
issue of Uplink, preferably by
writing a piece yourself. We
could also arrange for a
NICAR staff member to
interview you for a story.

The stories can be anything
from a few paragraphs to a few
pages-whatever it takes to
share what you learned.

Please contact us as soon as
possible if you're interested.

5,054 that stop at the tract level. Those are
just the counts. Our readers need to see percents
and percent changes to comprehend the counts.
And we need to sort counties, places, tracts, and
maybe even block groups and blocks by those
percents and percent changes to find the "most"
and the "least" to salt and pepper our stories.

Maybe this will be where the journalists are
separated from the demographers. How many of
us really need to work through 15 tables of 209
variables of Sex-by-Age for separate Race/Ethnicity
categories? There is one variable per year through
99, then years are grouped from 100 up.

But can we afford to ignore the nine tables of
49 variables each of Sex-by-Age for Race and
Ethnicity categories, with ages grouped?

The last time around we all
were in races to see how
much we could get into
tomorrow's paper from
today's clownload. That
approach won't work this
summer. Instead, we need to
learn how to cherry-pick.

The last time around we all were in races to
see how much we could get into tomorrow's pa-
per from today's download. That approach won't
work this summer. Instead, we need to learn how
to cherry-pick. That means learning how to reach
in and pull out the most delectable morsels of
data from an enormous pile that will crush us if
we're not prepared.

Cherry-pick
There are some obvious entry points. For in-
stance, Table PCT14, which has just seven vari-
ables describing "Unmarried-Partner Households
by Sex of Partner" down to the tract level. It is the
first time there has been such a table in census
data.

In fact, few of the 104 tables in the 1990 Sum-
mary Tape File 1 will have matching corollaries in
2000. The same race and multiple race defini-
tions that made PL94-171 difficult to compare
will plague us in Summary File 1.

Even something so basic as comparing age
groupings from 1990 to 2000 will be difficult
because the age groupings are different in each
census.

Where the stories from PL94-171 data largely
focused on change over the decade, stories from
Summary File 1 probably will paint more detailed
pictures of who we were in 2000 with less of who
we were in 1990. That's because of the richness of
detail to be presented in the new data.

Where five fields described Hispanic Origin
in 1990 there are 31 in 2000. Where there were
no tables in 1990 describing American Indians
and Alaska Natives, there are three tables with 47
variables each to do the job in 2000. Even Asian
origin, which was detailed in 1990 will be more
detailed in 2000 with the separation of Chinese
and Taiwanese and the addition of Bangladeshi,
Indonesian, Malaysian, Pakistani, and Sri Lankan.

The Group Quarters population also will be
richly detailed, down to the tract level, this time,
with categories of institutionalized and non-insti-
tutionalized persons broken down by male and
female in three age categories and by race and
Latino/Hispanic ethnicity.

All of those are in addition to the more de-
tailed household and family composition tables
coming this year compared to those provided in
1990.

What we learned from PL94-171 at the Los
Angeles Times was that planning and practice made
all the difference in our ability to deliver a com-
prehensive census r eport on deadline. I know that
many of you learned the same lessons because it
was apparent in the questions and answers shared
on nicar-l and census-l.

That job is going to be tougher the next time
around, despite assurances that we'll get several
days to wrestle the data under embargo before we
publish. It will be tougher because there will be so
much more of it that we'll be buried by it if we
don't have sound plans for managing it.

Planning
That planning can only begin by getting the
documentation and studying it. That means not
only the technical documentation for Summary
File 1, but also the documentation for STF 1 from
1990.

Then comes the decision-making. How many
stories are in there? How many geographies need
to be covered? When do they need to be covered?
Can you concentrate only on the summary levels
for states, counties and places, leaving tracts, block-
groups and blocks for later?

Which tables can you ignore? Which tables
provide the big picture and which include details
you'll never get into print or on the air anyway?

Is your computer up to the coming task? Is
your software? If you were working in Excel or
Access, can you do so again with so much more
data involved? Or, do you have to figure out a
way to divide and conquer?

Lessons learned
Here are a few things I learned the first time
around that may be of help.

A quick way to cut down the data load is to
start with a copy of the "Geo" file and discard all
of the SUMLEV values you don't need right away.
I got rid of everything below the county level ex-
cept whole places, whole tracts and whole block
groups and cut the file size to about a fifth of the
original. Then when I merged it with the tables,
they were cut down to size as well.

Cut local and regional files out of state files
and use those smaller files for detailed queries.
When I needed to know which tracts had the
most or least in Los Angeles County, I looked
only at Los Angeles County data.

Build universal query report forms. Mine were
in Microsoft Access and fed from a series of make-
table queries that each over-wrote the same table
name. The reports ran from that intermediate
table, so the field names were always the same. A
big surprise was learning that Access can't make
decent HTML tables from multi-column reports
(true for both Access 97 and Access 2000). The
solution was Adobe Acrobat. We printed the re-
ports as PDF files with the Acrobat PDF Writer.
They looked good, were easy to manage on both
our library intranet site and our Web site, they
were searchable, and they could be printed.

Adobe Acrobat was the tool of choice for map-
ping, too. The PDF files carried vector-graphic
colored polygons from ArcView theme maps into
Freehand where our artists could tweak them at
will. Plenty of testing with 1990 data and then
data from states released before California went
into this process. The result was the ability to pub-
lish 14 maps on deadline.

But some things don't change, or at least
change very slowly. Just as it was in 1990, the best
way to get the data to our reporters in outlying
bureaus in 2001 was the ubiquitous fax machine.
Now if only I could figure out how to get every-
thing I want on a report without resorting to 8-
point type.

CENSUS-L
Lots of kids

The following is a recent discussion on
CENSUS-L concerning a sliver of the PL94
data that could produce an interesting story:

I'm just starting to tackle a back-burner story
from the PL94 data: Neighborhoods with lots
of kids. I found one census tract in my area
that had more kids than adults. Then I ran the
numbers for the entire state, and found that
this is the only census tract in all of Virginia
with more kids than adults. My question: Has
anyone else run across tracts in their area that
have more kids than adults? That would be
tracts with more than 50% people age 17 and
under. I'm guessing this would be found in in-
ner-city, public housing neighborhoods, which
is where my special tract was.

A word of caution: make sure there aren't
group homes in that tract. You might want to
contact social service agencies (state and local)
to find out for sure.

I'm working on a version of the where's the
kids story, and two trends have come up. First,
we're seeing significant flight away from our
growing cities. Second, the kid concentrations
are turning up in the same block groups where
the Mormon temples or Indian reservation
towns are.

The SFI (short form) data
that starts coming out this
summer will be released to
news media on an
embargo basis (about 3-5
days).

Starting in early May, the
Census Bureau planned to
start releasing summary
information from this
short form data. These will
be in one-page Excel
spreadsheets or PDF
images. Samples are
available through Steve
Doig's Reporting Census

Data updates at NICAR
The following datasets have recently been updated at
the NICAR Database Library:
The 1999 FBI Uniform Crime Reports: Includes sum-
mary information from law enforcement agencies through-
out the country on index crimes. There are six tables to the
database, including one on homicides and another on ar-
sons. Cost for the entire U.S., all databases: $160, $320,
$345 depending on size of news organization. State slices
are available for: $55, $110, $135. You can also purchase
just one of the six databases. More information is available
at www.nicar.org/data/fbil
The 2000 National Bridge Inventory: Includes the most
recent inspection for all bridges in the United States. Bridges
include those for highways, railroads, pedestrian-bicycle,
overpasses, and those designated as historically significant.
The data has been used by many news organizations to
document problems with bridges in local areas. It is also
useful to have available in case of a breaking news story
involving a bridge. Cost for entire U.S.: $40, $80, $105. A
single state is: $15, $30, $55. More information is avail-
able at www.nicar.org/data/bridges/
FAA Accidents and Incidents: Includes all accidents and
incidents in the United States involving all types of air-
craft. The most recent incidents included in the data are
from early 2001, however not all incidents from 2000 were
entered into the database by the FAA by the time NICAR
received the data. The most current data, 1990 through
2000, costs: $40, $80, $105. NICAR also has data going
back to 1973 that is available separately. More information
is available at www.nicar.org/data/faaai/index.html
