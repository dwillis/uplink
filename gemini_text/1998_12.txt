UNDERMINING DEFINING
Suspect semantics
By Craig R. McCoy and Tom Torok
The Philadelphia Inquirer
Philadelphia sure is a law-abiding place.
It's a city where people aren't held up at
gunpoint. Instead, they have "disturbances,"
or, at worst, are subject to "threats." Victims
aren't beaten or stabbed. They are deemed
mere "hospital cases," coding for the police
taking someone to the hospital. Pocketbooks
aren't ripped off; they're booked as "missing
property." Thieves don't steal cars. Instead,
the car's forgetful owners lose them, and the
helpful cops write up the missing vehicles as
a "try and locate."

With artful classifications such as these,
Philadelphia's police department for years has
been fudging statistics for the FBI's influential
Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program.
This, in turn, has permitted mayor after mayor
to boast of the city's low crime rate.

Until the whole statistical deck of cards
came undone. In a series of articles over the
last year, The Philadelphia Inquirer has chal-
lenged the city's crime statistics, using com-
puterized reporting and a lot of old-fash-
ioned, shoe-leather interviewing to docu-
ment flaws in the numbers.

The finagling has had a big impact, both
for the citizenry as a whole and, on a very
personal level, for victims:

• At this point, no one really knows what
the true crime picture is for the city. In stages,
police over the last year have disowned the
citywide crime stats for 1996, 1997 (twice
withdrawn) and the first half of 1998.

• The scandal has damaged Philadelphia's
attempt to follow New York's lead and switch
over to police deployment based on comput-
erized trend-spotting and mapping.

• Some "downgradings" - the term for
converting a major crime to a minor one
have cut off cases from detectives, leaving
suspects free to strike again.

• Victims have lost their claim for com-
pensation under a state program that helps
pay for uninsured medical bills. No crime,
no victim, no compensation.

The stage for our reporting was set when
Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell, finally
responding to requests from the Inquirer and
the Philadelphia Daily News, released seven
years of underlying crime-by-crime data. This
massive computer file provided details on
more than 700,000 crimes deemed serious
by police from 1991 to 1997. Philadelphia is
one of few major American cities that release

CORRECTIONAL CARE
Prisoner health
By David Heath
St. Louis Post-Dispatch
While in an Alabama prison, 18-year-
old Calvin Moore melted before the eyes of
correctional doctors and nurses. Moore, a
burglar who suffered from severe mental
illness, lost 56 pounds in less than a month
- more than one-third of his body weight.
On Feb. 21, 1996, he died from dehydra-
tion and starvation in the care of St. Louis-
based Correctional Medical Services, the
industry giant in the rapidly growing
field of privatized correctional health care.

CMS said it provided Moore with
"appropriate and compassionate care." A
state report attributed the death to natu-
ral causes. However, a renowned expert
on forensic medicine and pathology from
the University of Colorado described
Moore's death as "a homicide resulting
from criminal negligence."

Word of Moore's death prompted the
St. Louis Post-Dispatch to spend five
months looking at the privatized correc-

TRAC & DATA FIELDS
Investigating the FBI
By David Burnham and Susan Long
TRAC
The FBI is an extraordinarily secretive
organization that routinely denies Congress,
reporters and the public comprehensive in-
formation about the matters it investigates,
the number of individuals who are indicted
and convicted as a result, or the distribution
of its staff in different parts of the country.

For many decades, this absence of con-
crete information has made it nearly impos-
sible to judge the bureau's actual perfor-
mance. Given America's faith in the theory of
accountability, the public acceptance of the
FBI position is surprising. It's as if General
Motors could sell stock without publishing
an annual report certified by an independent
accounting team.

Fortunately, however, the FBI's steadfast
resistance to public scrutiny can now be
challenged. This is possible because of the
Freedom of Information Act, the availability
of computerized data analysis programs and
the recognition that very detailed informa-
tion about the enforcement activities of the
bureau are recorded by the Justice
Department's Executive Office of United
States Attorneys (EOUSA). Previously, our
knowledge of FBI enforcement practices was
almost entirely limited to the announce-
ments and leaks from the FBI and the DOJ
about cases they wanted to publicize.

Stepping stones
The process of conducting an investiga-
tive audit of the FBI or for that matter a
local school district, sheriff's office, or state
police - almost always involves the same
basic steps, which often overlap as an inves-
tigation proceeds.

First, obtain comprehensive data about
the individual enforcement actions of the
agency you have targeted for examination
the records of its inspections, investigations,
arrests, referrals, audits, prosecutions, and so
on.

Second, check the accuracy by comparing
the data obtained from the targeted agency
with parallel information compiled by a sepa-
rate institution. Confidence in the general
accuracy of enforcement information in-
creases when two or more independent agen-
cies produce similar counts.

Third, sum the case-by-case information
so that significant aspects of the agency's
work product can be quantified. How many
drug prosecutions were there? How many
civil rights prosecutions? How many convic-
tions? How many were sentenced to prison?
An examination of this summary informa-

Because we began by
collecting referral-by-
referral data about all
kinds of enforcement
actions, however, we
could examine a highly
focused investigative
subject.

tion often reveals unusual patterns and trends.
Has there been a sharp and unexplained
surge, or decline, in one particular kind of
enforcement? Do records indicate the agency
is more successful in processing one group of
suspects than another? Is the agency focusing
a large proportion of its efforts on an unex-
pected subject? Do staffing patterns appear
reasonable?

Fourth, on the basis of these preliminary
revelations, interview responsible adminis-
trators and other knowledgeable persons to
gain their insights and criticisms. When the
data revelations are challenged, the challeng-
ers should always be asked to produce their
data.

FOIAing data's turnkeys
We have followed these four steps for
more than thirty years, initially working alone
from the somewhat different perspectives of
investigative reporter and research scholar.
Since 1989, when we joined forces as co-
directors of the Transactional Records Access
Clearinghouse (TRAC), we have sought to
make this kind of information widely avail-
able. (See http://trac.syr.edu)

A basic source of TRAC's enforcement
information is the EOUSA. Through the
aggressive use of the FOIA, TRAC has ob-

From page four: Toward accountability
tained referral-by-referral information about
all federal criminal matters and what hap-
pened to them from the period when this
system of records was developed in the mid-
1970s through fiscal year 1997. TRAC also
has obtained data from such agencies as the
IRS, ATF and Office of Personnel Manage-
ment, as well as the federal court system and
the GAO.

In late 1995, after obtaining comprehen-
sive data from the Justice Department about
the criminal enforcement activities of the
entire federal government, we decided the
time had come to systematically examine the
FBI, which in many ways is the most power-
ful and least accountable agency in the United
States.

From the beginning, we viewed our probe
of the FBI as a two-tracked project. One track
resulted in the publication of an investigative
article that comprised most of the August 11/
18, 1997 issue of The Nation. (See http://
www.thenation.com/issue/970811/0811burn.htm)
The second track was more unusual: the
organized data that served as the backbone of
our investigation became a Web site where
anyone could independently examine what
the bureau is doing, where it is doing it and
how the agency's current activities compare
with those of past. The site has more than
30,000 pages of maps, graphs, tables and
other material.

Door-breaking over deskwork
From our examination of the Justice
Department's enforcement data, GAO stud-
ies, court records and interviews with work-
ing and retired FBI officials, federal prosecu-
tors, judges, criminal defense lawyers and
other experts, we slowly developed a wide
range of findings about the FBI. One key
conclusion: the FBI spends a substantial pro-
portion of its investigative resources on mat-
ters that often could be handled by local
police and relatively little on problems that
can be dealt with best at the national level and
by the federal government. In 1996, for
example, bureau investigations resulted in
11,865 convictions. Half of them involved
drugs, bank robbery and fraud against banks,
frequently by credit card. By contrast, ac-
cording to department data, only 148 of the
convictions, 1.2 percent of the total, involved
medical fraud.

Interviews suggested that agents much
preferred the high-adrenalin, kick-in-the-door
cases over the demanding and sometimes
tedious work required to convict white-collar
criminals. The data proving the FBI has paid
relatively little attention to medical fraud - a
national problem of immediate concern to
millions of elderly Americans - is genuine
news by itself, confirmation of the rule that
what an agency does not do often is more
important than what it does. The health
fraud data were also valuable because they
measured uniquely the broad dimensions of
a significant failure of government. Because
we began by collecting referral-by-referral
data about all kinds of enforcement actions,
however, we could examine a highly focused
investigative subject.

From 1992 to 1996, the Justice Depart-
ment reported that federal prosecutors dis-
posed of 142 FBI matters it had classified as
involving internal security and terrorism
cases of highest concern by definition. But
the data showed only 22 percent of these 142
matters resülted in a conviction. In other
words, more than three-quarters were de-
clined by the prosecutors, dismissed by the
judges, or ended in a not-guilty verdict. Of
those matters that the Justice Department
decided to decline, about two-thirds were
tossed out because the prosecutors concluded
the evidence was too weak or legally flawed.

Marshaling the marshals
Though difficult because enforcement
agencies have different responsibilities, re-
porters can also marshal the Justice Depart-
ment to examine the FBI's effectiveness. One
approach is to compare how the FBI and
another agency handle a specific category of
cases. Both the FBI and DEA, for example,
enforce the nation's drug laws.

Through the sophisticated use of the Jus-
tice Department data now available through
TRAC, backed up by careful reporting of the
old-fashioned kind, the nation's most impor-
tant law enforcement agency can now be
subjected to the kind of examination it has
long required and almost never received.

From page one: Downgraded crimes
such detailed information, besides totals made
public twice a year by the UCR program.

Using Access and Excel, an Inquirer team
began to slice and dice the data. In some
ways, our focus was on the dogs that weren't
barking - crimes that weren't being booked.

Boom and bust thefts
Among our early articles was a straight
forward account, pegged to the FBI's na-
tional release, of the city's overall crime rate
for 1997. Even as we wrote it, we noticed a
weird trend in the data. When crimes were
analyzed by month, Philadelphia had a puz-
zling drop in car thefts in the first half of the
year, followed by a boom in the second. The
change was without precedent for Philadel-
phia; we could not explain it as seasonal.

We then took our analysis to the city's
police chief, John F. Timoney, for comment.

The numbers at issue had already been
withdrawn from the FBI count once. In late
1997 the Daily News first reported that the
city had been counting crimes based on when
they entered data into their computer system
rather than when crimes occurred. This
method made comparisons between years
and among cities haphazard at best.

Timoney, who inherited the mess when
he took command of the force in March
1998, had released new 1997 figures after
tallying them again for a regular Jan. 1-Dec.
31 calendar year.

Once he had digested the Inquirer's new
analysis, Timoney announced in May 1998
yet another inquiry into the 1997 figures, less
than a week after their re-release. In Septem-
ber, he provided the results: for the first half
of the year, police had by mistake dropped
3,000 property crimes - mostly stolen cars-
from the city's count.

Novelties and oddities
As we continued to explore the database,
other puzzling patterns emerged. A key
finding was Philadelphia's remarkably low
count of aggravated assaults compared to
murders. While almost every major city rou-
tinely books 50 such serious assaults for every
murder, Philadelphia was logging just 15 per
murder. Criminologists pointed us to data
showing that murder and serious assaults rose
and fell together in that ratio in most cities -
a not surprising tidal effect if you think of a
murder as an assault that goes too far.

Another oddity: attempted burglaries had
just about vanished in Philadelphia. For
example, the data let us see that two police
districts, with a total population of 138,000
people, reported a total of only six attempted

break-ins in 1997. Shoplifting figures had
been similarly low-balled. So had thefts of
auto licenses, a particularly troublesome Phila-
delphia problem.

Though Philadelphia's pervasive culture of
numbers chicanery may seem unusual, there is
no doubt that the problem prevails in munici-
palities large and small. Since the system's
founding nearly 70 years ago, major UCR
scandals have flared repeatedly. Experts have
been warning that the problem is growing
more virulent as departments put more stress
on the numbers, both to fight crime and to rank
commanders. In the last year statistical contro-
versies have been sparked in New York, New
Orleans, Baltimore, Atlanta and Boca Raton.

Shoe-leather series
As we worked over the data, we also inter-
viewed serving and retired police from beat
cops to commanders; victims and victims' ad-
vocates; town watch and civic group leaders;
and academic and policing experts nationwide.
We also consulted court records and ordered
scores of individual incident reports.

"going down with crime" – as the cops called
it internally - began to surface. Detectives

From page six: Accuracy efforts
and street cops told us how crimes were
blown off to lighten their workload. Others
spoke of constant pressure from the top, of
district commanders and even more senior
officials seeking to raise performance ratings
by putting a thumb on the scale of justice.

Our work culminated Nov. 1-2 in a series
that was actually sparing in its use of numbers
and charts. Instead, we told story after story
of actual victims and how the crime against
them had been downgraded. One article
explored violent crime; another tackled crimes
against property. Among the more dramatic
evidence were graphic reproductions of com-
plete police reports that had been rewritten to
downgrade the crimes. In the rewrites, key
information vanished, including descriptions
of suspects and weapons.

Wrongdoing and response
The issue has engendered considerable out-
rage in Philadelphia. For the first time, the city
controller, the top financial watchdog for the
city, is planning an audit of crime figures. U.S.
Attorney General Janet Reno has asked her
aides to examine the Philadelphia figures.

Timoney has sworn the 1998 figures will be
accurate, "if it kills me." He has transferred two
captains whose numbers were questioned and
created an aggressive auditing unit to check
figures. So far their investigation suggests that
as many as 5,500 crimes were buried in the first
half of 1998 one out of every 10.

After our series, Timoney ratcheted the
pressure higher. He announced that under-
cover police would pose as crime victims to
"sting" officers mishandling paperwork.

Character overload
While examining the Philadelphia figures,
we also looked at national data. We drew, in
part, upon unpublished FBI statistics that the
agency provides on magnetic tape (available
from NICAR) that includes in its entirety
crime data collected for the UCR program
much more detailed information than what is
available in print in the well-known Crime in
the United States publications. One problem is
the FBI sends the data in text that runs 8,000
characters across, four times the length that
most databases can handle. Using a Visual
Basic script, Torok helped break down the data
into usable sections. (Note from the Database
Library: NICAR processes the raw FBI data so
software using the.dbf format can handle them.)

At the paper's request, a sociologist at
Temple University had built an ArcView GIS
map of Philadelphia, which tagged each of
the city's 400 police sectors by neighbor-
hood. With this in hand, for one article
graphics artist Matthew Ericson allocated
crime by sector to each of Philadelphia's 56
neighborhoods. We ranked them by violent
crime and property crime rates.

Online database
With leads flowing in, we are still at work
on the issue. In one recent development, we
posted on The Inquirer's Web site, Philadel-
phia Online, the 700,000-crime database
that underpinned the entire effort. It took
considerable grooming to get the database
into usable form. Using Visual Basic, Torok
"parsed” the chaotic address field into dis-
crete block and street fields. His program
correctly separated all but 15,000 of the
crimes. Ericson then wrote a program in Perl
(CQ) that solved another particularly bad
6,000 addresses or so. We also deployed
scripts that fixed more than 100,000 mis-
spellings of street names.

Using Microsoft SQL Server, Torok then
created active server pages on the Web site that
permit readers to search the database rapidly
for crimes on their block over seven years, on
any one day, and by other methods. His
program ingeniously separates and indexes the
data by search method to produce quick results
from an immense dataset. It received more
than 24,000 page views its first day online. For
comparison, a well-browsed Inquirer sports
story receives around 3,000 "hits."

One of our first responses came in an e-mail,
edited slightly for confidentiality: "I looked for
an assault," a browser wrote us. "It must have
been downgraded since it is not listed at all. It
infuriates me that an assault is not reported.
The two men who did this meant to cause
bodily damage, but their act of cowardice
won't be known because the police department
is playing games with our lives."

We're looking into it.

"WE DON'T FILE OUT TAPES"
On the data offensive
By Bob Warner
Philadelphia Daily News
Police departments around the country
have been happy to take public bows for
declining crime rates. But in many cases,
they're still refusing to provide news organi-
zations with electronic data that would allow
closer scrutiny of their records.

As of early 1998, police departments in
the nation's three biggest cities - New York,
Los Angeles and Chicago - were unwilling to
release any data to reporters describing indi-
vidual crimes. Houston's police department
said it would be willing to release electronic
data, but as of last January nobody had asked.
Of the five biggest cities, only the Philadel-
phia police were providing the media with
electronic data on local crime-and only after
a two-year fight requiring intervention by a
progressive mayor.

The Philadelphia Daily News began ask-
ing the police department for various pieces
of electronic data – drug arrests, stolen cars,
etc. - in 1994. With the exception of a small
database describing city homicides, our re-
quests were turned down, flatly and repeat-
edly, by the department's chief counsel and
its day-to-day spokeswoman. In early 1996,
we began asking for more comprehensive
data - the past five years of criminal offenses
reported to police, known to a small group
inside the department as the "offense tapes."
Once again, we were turned down. "We
don't give out tapes," the department's
spokeswoman told us.

Pennsylvania's public records law offered
us little support. Written in 1957, it does not
mention computers or electronic data. It
contains a troublesome exemption for any
records disclosing the institution or progress
of a criminal investigation. Since the police
claimed to investigate all Part 1 crimes re-
ported to it, its lawyers would occasionally
argue that this exemption covered any records
on crimes reported to police.

Media allies
But we had an ally in the city's mayor, Ed
Rendell, whose top aides had the common
sense to manage the news media by provid-
ing information, not withholding it. Unoffi-
cially, they had long since agreed to the
principle that documents considered public
records on paper should also be considered
public records when they're kept in an elec-
tronic format. We asked the mayor's office to
review our dispute with the police.

It was a ticklish matter for the mayor's
office, which had repeatedly been accused by
the police officers' union of trying to run the
department from the second floor of City
Hall. But some sort of message was actually
delivered to Police Commissioner Richard
Neal, telling him he'd have to give us some
data or provide reasonable explanations for
withholding them.

Called and cornered
We still had trouble getting Neal to return
our calls. Finally, we cornered him as he was
kicking off a pedestrian safety campaign.
That led to a series of three meetings, going
through the department's record layouts and
negotiating precisely what data would be
turned over. The newspaper agreed to live
without victim's names and addresses, but
the department agreed to identify the blocks
or intersections where crimes had occurred.

The agreement nearly fell apart with Neal's
next phone call. Our data was ready, he said,
but the Daily News would have to pay $2,089
in advance to cover the department's
programming costs. Reluctantly, we agreed.

It didn't take long to find evidence of the
department's bogus crime-counting practices:
thousands of crimes from 1995 had been
included in the data used to come up with
1996 crime totals for the FBI. It soon became
clear that the department's annual crime
counts were based on when they fed data into
their computer system rather than when the
crimes occurred.

Our stories forced the department to with-
draw crime figures previously submitted to
the FBI for 1996 and 1997. More impor-
tantly, they became Exhibit A in a hot public
debate over the effectiveness of the police
department and the competence of Com-
missioner Neal. Five months later, Neal sub-
mitted his resignation. His successor, John
Timoney, made clear on taking office that
reform of the department's criminal data
system would be one of his top priorities.
Timoney has followed through.

CRIME WITHOUT PUNISHMENT
Inmate abuse
By Jim Hopkins
The Courier-Journal
Shortly after midnight on Jan. 7, 1998, a
34-year-old inmate died after a struggle with
guards in the Jefferson County jail in Louis-
ville, Ky. Within days, the county coroner
ruled his death a homicide, setting off mul-
tiple investigations by the jail, the police,
prosecuting attorney and The Courier-Jour-
nal.

Early on, we reported that three of the
five guards involved had prior on-the-job
disciplinary records, including one who had
been accused of inmate abuse. That piqued
my curiosity and a question that formed the
basis of our inquiry: How many other offic-
ers in the department had been disciplined,
and for what violations?

The answer came the following month
when we reported that nearly 90 percent of
the jail's 350 guards had been disciplined for
violating workplace rules. One-fifth had been
found guilty of major offenses such as in-
mate abuse, insubordination and sleeping
on the job. Serious punishment, such as
termination, was rare. One officer had been
disciplined 48 times more than any other
- for violations that included pummeling an
inmate in the face and then trying to cover
up the incident. Management had tried to
fire him twice but failed after he appealed to
an employee grievance board.

Open-records
accommodations
To reach our conclusion, we relied heavily
on computer analysis and Kentucky's open-
records laws to review all the disciplinary
records of current and former jail-house
staff. With our findings in hand, we turned
to the Internet to find jail-management ex-
perts to place the situation in a national
context.

In the wake of our report and a follow-up
piece that looked exclusively at inmate abuse,
jail managers negotiated a new contract with
the union representing guards that is sup-
posed to make it easier to punish officers
who don't follow the rules while keeping an
eye on the jail's approximately 1,600 in-
mates.

When we first asked the jail for all em-
ployee disciplinary records, we were pre-
sented with a loose-leaf log that listed every
employee offense, the date, a brief descrip-
tion of the offense, the recommended pun-
ishment, and the outcome. The log became
our road map.

Unfortunately, the log wasn't computer-
ized. Using Paradox, I entered each incident

I included every scrap of
information in the log
because I wasn't sure
what would be important
until I was finished.

and eventually created a 2,236-record data-
base. I included every scrap of information in
the log because I wasn't sure what would be
important until I was finished.

I detected patterns almost immediately:
Some employees had been punished dozens
of times; management seldom recommended
termination; and employees often got their
punishments overturned on appeal. For ex-
ample, our analysis showed that nearly 34
percent of all recommended suspensions had
been reduced by the employee grievance
board. About 70 percent of the recommended
firings taken to the board were reduced to
lesser punishments.

In the case of the inmate who had died,
three of the five officers involved had prior
infractions that could have led to termina-
tion. But in only one instance was firing
recommended, and that recommendation
was tossed out during the grievance process.

The employee grievance panel, it turned
out, gave management and the Teamsters
union an equal number of votes when decid-
ing cases appealed to the board. Our analysis
showed that virtually all discipline that in-
volved a suspension or termination were
appealed to the board. Anxious to avoid a
prolonged appeal if they stuck to their guns,
managers repeatedly struck bargains with
the union.

tional health-care industry. Reporters found
more than 20 cases in which inmates died as
a result of alleged negligence, indifference,
under-staffing, inadequate training or cost-
cutting by for-profit HMOs.

Information obstacles
The search for information was not easy.
State correctional agencies were generally
uncooperative, concerning the backgrounds
of CMS physicians. We knew from anec-
dotal evidence that some had checkered pasts.
The problem was obtaining a list of all CMS
doctors and matching them against a data-
base of disciplinary actions by state medical
boards.

Although the data we needed existed, it
required sweat to obtain and make usable. A
database of unprofessional and incompetent
behavior by medical doctors, called the Na-
tional Practitioner Data Bank (www.
npdb.com), is maintained by the U.S. De-
partment of Health and Human Services.
However, federal law prohibits the names of
the doctors in the database from being di-
vulged to the public. That information is
only disclosed to hospitals, health care enti-
ties, state licensing boards, and, in some
cases, attorneys.

The Missouri State Board of Registration
for the Healing Art is more open with disci-
plinary data. The board even posts the phy-
sician license database, which includes a field
of disciplinary actions (www.ecodev.state.mo.
us/pr/).

Index end-run
The only comprehensive database avail-
able to the public is provided by Public
Citizen, a consumer group founded by Ralph
Nader. The data come in a four-volume set of
books priced at $307.50. It can be ordered
from the Web site (www.publiccitizen.org).
Regional listings are available for $23.50.

The books provide an abstract of actions
taken against doctors (including arrests), ac-
tions taken by state licensing boards, and ac-
tions taken by the Drug Enforcement Admin-
istration. While it is a gold mine of informa-
tion, it is organized by state rather than by
doctors' names-aproblem since many doctors
with disciplinary histories move around. Even
the index was difficult to navigate, because it
was grouped by type of action.

We solved these problems by scanning the
75-page index and writing a short program in
Visual Basic to parse the fields into a data-
base. We posted a search form on a password-
protected Web site that we shared, at first,
only with members of the project team. When
the series ran, we made that database avail-
able to everyone in the newsroom on our
Intranet. The Web site allows reporters to
search doctors by name.

Prying with contracts
Our bigger problem was obtaining the
names of doctors working for CMS in order
to match them against our data. Our com-
puter-assisted-reporting specialist, Julie Lucas,
contacted 26 states in which CMS does busi-
ness to ask for a list of doctors working there
and the contract the state signed with CMS.

In virtually every case, the states at first
refused to provide us with the list of doctors,
claiming that they did not have that informa-
tion or directing us to contact CMS directly.
(CMS declined to share the data as well.) We
did routinely obtain the CMS contracts,
however. In some cases, those contracts pro-
vided the leverage we needed to pry the list of
CMS doctors from the states. In nearly every
contract, CMS was bound to provide the
state correctional department with a current
list of their doctors. We used that contract
language to persuade several states that the
doctors' names were a public record.

Even so, two states, Virginia and Arkan-
sas, claimed that we weren't entitled to the
information because their open record acts
apply only to state residents. In actuality,
Virginia's law specifically states that newspa-
pers circulating in the state are entitled to
public records. We proved that we sell some
papers there. In Arkansas, we enlisted the
help of Jeff Porter, the computer-assisted
reporting editor at the Arkansas Democrat-
Gazette, who managed to get the list of doc-
tors within a day.

Our efforts paid off. We had numerous
hits on our database from the list of doctors
we received from the states. In fact, doctors
with questionable backgrounds became a
major theme in the series.

FIRST VENTURES
Death on the job
Bill Muller
The Arizona Republic
Bill Muller attended the NICAR basic boot
camp in August 1997.
It was one of those moments that every
reporter dreads. I woke up in the middle of
the night staring at the ceiling. After analyz-
ing an OSHA database, I had just finished
writing a story about workplace deaths in
Arizona. In cases where there was a serious
safety violation, I had identified 108 deaths
since 1992 and established the median fine
per fatality: about $3,000.

But now I tossed and turned. What if
there were more than 108 deaths? What if the
data was flawed? Our analysis would be worth-
less.

Luckily, though I already had written the
story, its run date was still weeks away.
The next day, I called the director of the
state industrial commission, who I had come
to know well during the project, and told
him of my misgivings. Without hesitation,
he agreed to have a member of his staff go
through all workplace deaths since 1992 and
make sure we had them all.
We didn't.

Undocumented deaths
Due to some reporting problems on
OSHA's part, 26 deaths were not in our
analysis. Using data provided by the com-
mission, we added the deaths into the Excel
spreadsheet that we had used to calculate the
median. A funny thing happened: The me-
dian was still about $3,000.

In picking median for analysis, we had
done ourselves a favor. When we added the
missing cases, some came in above and some
came in below, and the median stayed about
the same.

Still a good lesson. Some other findings:
• From 1992 until mid-1997, 79 of the
134 worker deaths investigated by OSHA in
Arizona led to citations for serious safety
violations. Just 12 fines were more than
$10,000.

• Though OSHA fines related to work-
place deaths might start high, the appeal
system is designed to reduce them. In fact, an
analysis of initial fines and current fines
showed that they dropped by about 40 per-
cent, saving the companies involved about
half a million dollars.

• For widows and widowers of workers
who die on the job, Arizona ranks low for
survivor benefits. State law protects compa-
nies from wrongful death lawsuits, saying
essentially that employees covered by work-
ers' compensation cannot recover damages in
the event of injury or death.

Though OSHA fines
related to workplace
deaths might start high,
the appeal system is
designed to reduce them.

Early experiments
Naturally, getting the answers wasn't as
easy as we first thought. It was my first time
dealing with a fairly large database-about 30
MB, with four tables and 43,000 records in
the largest table. The data weren't laid out
quite the way I thought they would be.

For example, when I first calculated the
fines per death (sorted in Access, then
crunched in Excel), I noticed that each record
included only one company name. This
puzzled me because I knew several cases in
which more than one company had been
fined in connection with a death. To get the
death cases, you had to link the accident table
with the OSHA table by case ID number.
Each time I asked for cases with '1' in the
degree field (the death code), I got the same
list and only one company name for each
deceased worker.

I decided to experiment. I sorted the data
by date and then by address, looking for
investigations in the OSHA table that oc-
curred on the same date and at the same
address as deaths in the accident table. Essen-
tially this worked. To make sure the cases
were related (and not just OSHA inspectors
spotting unrelated violations on the job site),
we checked the related activity numbers that
appear on the case records available on the
OSHA Web site. We also had the industrial
commission check our work. They found

TECH TIP
Programmers aplenty
By Steve Doig
Arizona State University
A big part of the fun for most CAR folks
is the challenge of solving puzzles. Our projects
tend to be one-of-a-kind things, so we're
constantly facing new data formats with
strange layouts (at least to us), undocumented
codes and other idiosyncrasies. Even though
no one else in the newsroom understands
how difficult the struggle was, we get a rush
of satisfaction from finally beating an unruly
dataset into submission.

When tackling such data puzzles, a great re-
source is the NICAR-L list. Even if you've never
faced variable-length records or packed
hexadecimals or YYYYDDMM dates or bitmaps
or other weirdness, chances are good that others
have. And perhaps the most instructive thing
about the flurry of postings often generated by an
interesting question is the wide range of clever
solutions offered. Over and over, we discover that
-in CAR-there are a lot of ways to get from here
to there.

A case in point was the "ugly data" contest
I tossed onto NICAR-L this summer. It not
only provided a stimulating puzzle for some
of our best propeller-heads, but the results
also proved the versatility of the CAR toolbox.

I found this puzzle in a big tape dataset sent
to me by a reporter who needed it in a more
useful format and on CD-ROM. The data,
which came as a courts database involving civil
suits, offered several kinds of ugliness:

• The structure was hierarchical: For each
case there was one case record and then as
many individual party records as there were
parties to the case. But the case record didn't
say how many party records would follow.
Nor was there a common field, like case
number, to link case and parties.

• Each "line" of the data was composed of
exactly 100 of the above case and party records,
with no delimiters between records. Thus, a
"line" might be anywhere from 4,500 to
about 6,000 characters long. If the last case
still had more parties when the 100-record
limit was reached, the rest would spill across
to a new "line."

• The file layout we were given was wrong.
It didn't mention that each case record began
with "0026" and each party record with
"0055." Later, I figured out that this undocu-
mented feature was supposed to be the length
of each record type, though why the file
creators felt the need to repeat this for every
record is beyond me.

• Nor were the supposed record lengths of
26 or 55 characters reliable. Some, but not
all, records ended with one, two or three
carets, for no apparent reason.

It took me an afternoon of noodling with

Over and over, we
discover that – in CAR -
there are a lot of ways to
get from here to there.

SAS, my database program of choice, to
figure out a way to read the data and trans-
form it into something useful. I've been on a
long campaign to convince CAR power users
that SAS is better than more commonly used
programs such as Access or FoxPro, particu-
larly for ugly data like this. So I created the
"Ugly Data Contest," urging anyone inter-
ested to tackle it with whatever tools they
wanted. I was sure their struggles, and the
relative simplicity of my SAS program, would
win some converts.

The roads to solution
I won't go into all the details of the results
here (you can check the NICAR-Larchives of
August 4-10, 1998, by going online at http:/
/www.nicar.org/nicarl.html). But I was sur-
prised and delighted - despite my pro-SAS
agenda - at the wide variety and inventive-
ness of the solutions that came in.

Along with my SAS program, there were
FoxPro programs from Greg Reeves of the
Kansas City Star and Griff Palmer of the Daily
Oklahoman; a Visual Basic solution from
David Heath of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch; a
stand-alone Visual Basic GUI from Dan
Keating of The Miami Herald; a Word-and-
Excel method-in-concept (that I called the
"ugly solution" winner!) from Russ Clemings
of the Fresno Bee, a Visual FoxPro/SQL ap-
proach from Jeff Porter of the Arkansas Demo-
crat-Gazette, and a text editor/Monarch solu-
tion from Dick van Eijk of NRC Handelsblad
in Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

Crime data online
By Heather Browne
NICAR
Covering crime is not for the faint of heart.
Crime statistics, for their part, can be daunting
or difficult to locate. The vast array of criminal
statistics out there can be hard to navigate, but
the Web helps narrow it into categories. Some
sites offer answers to frequently asked ques-
tions for data that needs explanation or provide
tutorials for analyzing the data. The following
are just a few of the many sites that offer
everything from interesting crime tidbits to
vast databases. They are good places to start
and can lead to more specific sites.

The FBI Home Page
www.fbi.gov
This site is the premier source for the latest
in crime stats. Not only can you check out
who's who on the "Most Wanted" list, but you
can also get the most recent version of "Crime
in the U.S.," which summarizes Uniform Crime
Reports (UCR) from agencies throughout the
country. (Click on "Crime Statistics") It in-
cludes trends and thorough explanations, which
save time. Also available is the National Inci-
dent-Based Reporting System, the latest wave
in reporting crime.

The Bureau of Justice Statistics
www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs
The U.S. Department of Justice offers much
in the way of statistics on both victims and
offenders. Findings from the National Crime
Victimization Survey can flesh out FBI data-
the survey may account for unreported crimes.
This site also offers spreadsheets in trend data,
information on courts and sentencing, and
much more. It incorporates different data
sources, so it is very useful in tracking crimes
through the various stages of criminal justice. A
lot of the data is available to order.

The Justice Information Center
www.ncjrs.org
This site offers in-depth information that
supplements FBI and other crime statistics. It
includes statistics in areas such as homicide
reports, arrests, and juvenile court, or victim
information. For specific topics, such as "Crime
Prevention" or "Juvenile Justice," it lists links
to relevant Web sites, mailing lists, and articles.
Definitely check out its extensive list of sites for
criminal justice statistics at http://www.ncjrs.org/
statwww.htm.

The National Consortium for Justice
Information and Statistics
www.search.org
If the data you're looking at appears to be a
scrambled mess, visit this site for background.
It offers information on courts, NIBRS, and
can lend technical support. The consortium
site gives dates for conferences and symposia in
crime statistics and criminal justice. It can also
link you to the Clearinghouse, another wealthy
source of information for reading and analyz-
ing data on law and order in the U.S.

FedStats
www.fedstats.gov
This site is simply awesome. It links you to
any government agency and is simple to follow.
It calls itself "one-stop shopping” for statistics,
programs, and policy. Maintained by the Fed-
eral Interagency Council on Statistical Policy,
federal statistics from the FBI, DEA, and many
more agencies are just a click away. FedStats
also lists agency contacts.

Organized Crime
www.crime.org
Not the Mafia, though you could probably
link to them. This site, which is easy to move
around in, provides tutorials on reading crime
statistics and links to all the major sites. It helps
answer questions on crime data and points out
possible inaccuracies. Check it out for nothing
else but the always enlightening "criminal
quote." The designer, Regina Schekall, plans
to develop the site further.

Number Crunchers Precision Journalism
www.crunch.com
This site is devoted to journalists. It
"crunches" the numbers, based on the adage
that "journalists don't do math." It's got some
"top secret" FBI files, now available under the
Freedom of Information Act. You can look up
the rap sheet of Al Capone, for example. A
glitzy, colorful site, it offers data and spread-
sheets on crime trends.

National Archive of Criminal Justice Data
www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD
This site offers a wide array of background
information, technical support, and data. If
you need to wade through all that, go ahead,
but the site offers a link straight to the
downloadable data, found in outline form. Just
click on the subject you'd like to see: correc-
tions, police, victimization surveys, and more.

STATS FROM THE ROAD
Calculating inflation
By Sarah Cohen
NICAR
Almost every comparison using dollars over
a number of years should be adjusted for
inflation. It's simply not fair to talk about salary
or budget increases since the 1970s without
building in inflation.

Not enough reporters do this, and that's a
shame. It's also now inexcusable. The data is
sitting on the Web, as are tools that make the
simple calculation for you.

A recent question from an IRE member
prompted me to test a variety of these inflation-
adjustment (or cost-of-living) calculators on
the Web. I was looking for results consistent
with my own calculations, documentation that
let me verify how they'd come to an answer,
and a simple interface that clearly guided me to
enter data for the answer I expected.

Not many of the tools met my challenge.

And the winner is...
Only George Landau's NewsEngin tool
passed in all categories: accuracy, documenta-
tion and ease of use. Landau, a longtime IRE
member, also confirms the date of the last
update, letting you know his data is up-to-the-
minute accurate. The instructions of some
calculators were so indecipherable that you
could easily make a mistake filling them out.
Others introduced rounding errors or slightly
erroneous data into their calculations.

Any site that doesn't keep
its data up to date and
doesn't provide details on
how it performs its
calculations ought to be
eliminated from your list of
bookmarks.

The rounding error isn't very worrisome. In
fact, if rounding makes such a big difference in
an answer, there's a good reason to report the
answers at a general level. There's no reason to
imply a false sense of precision when doing
work based on indexes with bigger flaws than
a calculation would introduce.

But any site that doesn't keep its data up to
date and doesn't provide details on how it
performs its calculations ought to be elimi-
nated from your list of bookmarks. It's just not

worth the effort to worry that you've filled it
out incorrectly, that it's using the correct for-
mula, or that the data is out of date.

How the calculators calculate
Generally, you type in a value like a salary.
You tell the inflation adjuster what year the
salary applies to and in what year you want it
expressed. Then you receive an inflation-ad-
justed figure.

Almost all of the calculators assume you
want to inflate previous year dollars. So if you
type in $25,000, 1975 and 1997, you'll get
what a salary of $25,000 in 1975 would be
today, after inflation.

That's usually how we do it, even though
the instructions on official Web sites imply you
ought to use some other base year. The reason
is that readers, viewers and listeners can picture
what a dollar is worth today. Few accurately
remember what it was worth a long time ago.

On your own
Instead of depending on someone else,
most reporters who deal with dollar values
like budgets, salaries or home values ought to
learn how to compute inflation-adjusted fig-
ures themselves.

Then you can leave the Web tools where
they belong - as a check on your own work.
It's not hard. I promise. Here's the for-
mula:
(CPINow/CPI Then) * Value then = Old
dollars inflated to compare in new dollars.

To get the CPI, just visit the BLS home
page at http://www.bls.gov www.bls.gov. Then
choose "Data," and "Most requested series."

From page ten: Seeking SAS converts
But my favorite solution used an entirely
unexpected tool: PERL, the "print extrac-
tion and report language" loved by Unix
wizards and cgi-scripters. Matt Ericson of the
Philadelphia Inquirer's web operation did it
with these five lines:
• Put a new line after any party record
perl-i-pe 's/(\d\d\d\d\d\d) {\d\d\d\d) ([CP])/
\1\n\3/g' ug.txt
• Put a new line after any case record
perl -i -pe 's/(\d\d\d\d\d\d\w\w\wwww
(\d\d\d\d) ([CP])/\1\n\3/g' ug.txt
• Fix any line that still starts with a 4 digit
number, which seems to appear after the ^s
perl-1-pe 's/^\d\d\d\d//;' ug.txt
• Kill any As
perl -i -e 's/\^//g;' ug.txt
• Merge the cases and parties
perl -i -pe 'if (/^C/) { $c=$_; $_="";
chop($c) } else { $_="$c $_" }' ug.txt
I still say SAS is best for handling the
widest range of ugly data and other CAR
problems. (I am, however, starting to learn
some PERL!) But the contest showed it's
possible to make almost any CAR tool do
almost any CAR task. As the old saying goes:
"When all you have is a hammer, every
problem looks like a nail."

From page seven: Grievous reductions
base was the biggest problem; virtually all the
jail records were paper. I don't enjoy data-
entry work, but there didn't seem to be any
other way. It took about three solid days, but
in cases like this I do the work myself because
I can see trends early on, which helps me
draft the story as I go. Inputting data myself
also makes me feel more confident about
accuracy.

The employee log was only a starting
point; it included virtually no details from
individual disciplinary cases. To learn more
about inmate abuse and excessive force, for
example, I had to isolate the names of all 34
officers accused of such violations in the
past. Then I requested their complete per-
sonnel files. That led to a second story,
which concluded that although inmate deaths
at the hands of guards were rare, incidents of
excessive force and abuse were not.

Lessons learned
What's true in traditional reporting also
is true in computer-assisted reporting: A
newspaper's greatest ally is the open-records
law. In this case, however, the records told
only part of the story. Although jail manag-
ers knew they were having a hard time en-
forcing the rules, they didn't know how
serious the problem was because they had
never taken a close look at their own records.
That's where computer analysis proved in-
valuable.

Finally, database stories can be pretty dull
stuff without concrete examples. Part of
what made our two stories compelling was
our focus on case studies, including the
officer who had been disciplined 48 times.
Using the database as a guide to inmate
abuse cases, for example, I described in detail
situations where guards had beaten inmates
held down by other officers, falsified reports
to cover up their actions, and gotten off scot-
free.

one related case that didn't turn up, mostly
because it was added to the case file a month
after the accident.

Scanning for the striking
After generating our initial list of 108
deaths, we searched the data for cases that
would be interesting. We looked for small
fines, large fines, and large fines that hadn't
been paid (by checking the "penalty remit"
field in the data). I also went through the
newspaper library, scanning for details on
various cases.

We found striking cases, including a small
company that had dodged a $47,000 fine by
declaring bankruptcy and another that was
fined just $7,500 after a worker had been
decapitated. To find the relatives of these
victims, many of whom had scattered, we
used Auto Track, locating one relative in Roch-
ester, N.Y., and another by sending letters to
her last two known addresses.

Also, after an editor asked the question, I
went back to the data to find out if we could
document the total amount that OSHA fines
had been lowered during the appeal process.
Fortunately, the data allowed such a calcula-
tion by including "current penalty" and "ini-
tial penalty" fields. Because of ongoing ap-
peals, the fines associated with more recent
cases tended to change, so we updated them
using the OSHA Web site establishment
search. (See http://www.osha.gov/cgi-bin/est/
est1)

But 26 fatalities were still missing from
the records. The reason, as far as we can tell,
was that state officials had not filled out the
accident summary when logging the case. So
while the accident appeared in the main
OSHA table, it was not in the accident table,
which contained the degree field and the
name of the victim.

I used the records provided by state OSHA
to update my chart, and the rest is history.
By the way, you might want to replace
that frayed electric cord.

IRE and NICAR on the crime beat
As you can see from this issue, reporting on crime in the
United States is becoming more sophisticated each year as
reporters try to give it context and depth. IRE and NICAR are
working with several groups to improve reporting on crime.
One project involves the Berkeley Media Studies Group
and the Missouri School of Journalism. The project is trying
to show journalists how to strengthen daily reporting on
crime and violence by making use of datasets and historical
information. It also tries to link the reporters to public
health experts who study the topic intensely.
Lori Dorfman from Berkeley and veteran reporter Jane
Stevens are leading the effort. Both have some radical ideas
about daily reporting on crime and violence and are taking
their message into newsrooms.
The role of IRE and NICAR is to help provide meaning-
ful hands-on training and examples of stories that use
combinations of datasets and shoe-leather reporting. IRE
and NICAR also hope to work with a newly created
association on crime reporting to provide manuals, tipsheets
and booklets about covering different aspects of the beat:
the cop shop, the court, the prison.
If you have ideas or want to help on either of these
projects, please contact Brant Houston by e-mail at
brant@ire.org

Conferences abound
Information on upcoming IRE and NICAR national
and regional conferences is now available on the IRE Web
