Uplink update

It's like the old Groucho Marx
joke: Math is so easy a 12 year old
can do it.
Quick. Get me a 12 year old.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch did
just that. In February, the newspaper
recounted how Carrie Coughlin used
statistics to figure out the home court
advantage in Big Eight basketball.
And she checked for significance.
For journalists, statistics are one
more way to better cover stories.
"Computer-assisted reporting
gives greater access to greater vol-
umes of information," Philip Meyer
said. "That means there is a greater
capacity for making mistakes. By
learning how to use statistics, we
reduce the risk of getting it wrong."
In this issue, Uplink offers stories
so you get it right.
Meanwhile, in the wake of the
Oklahoma City bombing, Nora Paul
trolls the Internet for militia groups.
Uplink also updates government ac-
cess to electronic records.

Reporters tell how statistics nailed big stories
Crunch Those Numbers
By Gwen Carleton
NICAR staff

When hospital officials told The New
York Times that babies were dying be-
cause of unusually sick mothers, re-
porter Josh Barbanel knew what to do.
He ran a regression. And like many
reporters who work with statistics, he
found a story: babies born in New York's
public hospitals are significantly more
likely to die than those born in private
hospitals even when the babies are
born healthy.
Statistics have always been a power-
ful tools in the hands of knowledgeable
journalists. Now, as more news organi-
zations invest in computers and statisti-
cal software, number crunching is more
important.
Statistics-savvy journalists are prov-
ing that statistics can mean more accu-
rate, incisive reporting. In recent months,
Minneapolis' WCCO-TV found mis-
takes in a state report on unwed mothers.
The Raleigh News & Observer showed
the link between ex-convicts who keep
commiting crimes and drug or alcohol
abuse. In December 1993, U.S. News &
World Report proved that black students
were more likely to be relegated to spe-
cial education programs.

Proving the point
The New York Times published "Mis-
managed Care: How Public Hospitals
Fail" on March 5-7. The story did not
need statistics to get into the paper,
Barbanel said. Reporters Dean Baquet
and Jane Fritsch had already uncovered
scores of horror stories.
"But (the story had been) argued
through anecdotes. Someone who didn't
believe unnamed sources could dispute
it," he said. The numbers made it harder
to dismiss.
Barbanel's analysis showed the in-
fant mortality rates were significantly
different even after accounting for such
variables as prenatal care, the mothers'
health and the babies' health. The num-
bers also allowed the newspaper to ques-
tion the causes.
Barbanel and others have discovered
that a careful analysis can quiet contro-

When an apple

By Andrew Lehren
NICAR staff

So you can figure out percent-
ages, and recall some math taught in
school.
Philip Meyer, a founder of com-
puter-assisted reporting and author
of The New Precision Journalism,
believes there is much more report-
ers can do with numbers to improve
their stories. In a recent Uplink inter-
view, the Pulitzer Prize winner listed
several tips:
• Avoid apples-and-oranges com-
parisons. Among the most common,
he said, "is any story where there is
a dollar comparison over time." In
other words, a newspaper may have
cost only a few cents at the turn of the
century. But before you get misty
eyed about the good old days, don't
forget to figure for inflation. Report-

Wiring Washington
Access tight for electronic records
By David H. Morrissey
Colorado State University

President Clinton issued Freedom of Infor-
mation Act guidelines in 1993 that he said would
expand public access to federal computerized
data.
A year later, Congress initiated on-line access
to thousands of federal documents by passing the
General Printing Office Electronic Information
Access Enhancement Act.
Both actions were responses to the fact that-
within five years -75 percent of Washington's
vast storehouse of documents will be created,
stored and disseminated electronically.
Without electronic access, the public will
have little ability to check what Washington
does. A key question now is: How much access
do we have?
The answer halfway through the Clinton ad-
ministration is clearly "not enough."

Clinton policies
The Clinton FOIA policy is the first by a
president to specifically mention the public's
right to electronic records. The president encour-
aged agencies "to enhance public access through
the use of electronic information systems."
Clinton's policy also limits when the Justice
Department can defend agencies withholding
documents requested under FOIA. Prior to this,
Reagan/Bush FOIA guidelines established in
1981 required the Justice Department to defend
agencies if there was "a substantial legal basis"
for secrecy. In effect, agencies were told "when
in doubt, deny requests."
Clinton changed that. He requires agencies to
cite specific "foreseeable harm" before the Jus-
tice Department will defend them, a policy often
called, "When in doubt, release."
Unless this new standard is overturned by a
new president, Clinton's policy should eventu-
ally increase public access to electronic records.
In addition, the president ordered in 1993 a
review of the security classification system. A
draft executive order from this review expands
national security information releasable under
the FOIA expanding electronic access in the
process - and overturns a Reagan-era executive
order encouraging secrecy.
On April 17, the order was issued, and it
expands the amount of information available.

Congress, meanwhile, has twice recently at-
tempted to address electronic records. In 1994,
the House killed a Senate bill that would define
FOIA-releasable records to include "computer
programs, machine readable materials, and com-
puterized, digitized, and electronic information..."
The bill, which may be reintroduced, would
require agencies to make reasonable efforts to
create or modify computer programs to retrieve
records; create computer programs to separate
disclosable from non-disclosable information;
and provide information in formats specified by
requesters.
Meanwhile, in 1994, Congress did pass the
GPO Access Act. The GPO now provides on-
line access to several thousand government docu-
ments.
While useful, the act remains fundamentally
flawed. Congress left agencies in control of what
records will be available electronically -- not the
requesters. The measure covers only some of
Washington's electronic information. No agency
is required to release electronic records; their
compliance is voluntary.

Few real changes
Despite the president's call for openness, and
congressional encouragement, few agencies are
rushing into the electronic future. I surveyed 70
federal agencies after the Clinton FOIA policy
was announced, and found not one had changed
policies to make access to electronic records
easier. Some called the president's policy too
vague. Others claimed they already practiced
maximum disclosure and saw no need to change
policies.
Detailed presidential or congressional action
may increase public access to Washington's in-
formation. Passing the FOIA demonstrated this
change. But as responses from the 70 agencies
suggest, broad policy statements produce only
minimal agency change. Many electronic records
remain difficult to obtain. The agencies — not
the public — still set most policies guiding
release of electronic federal records.

Technical Journalism at Colorado State University.

The long fight for electronic records
You may have a friend in Pa.
By Bob Warner
Philadelphia Daily News

Whatever's happening in Washington, the
information revolution is slower in some state
capitals.
It took 18 months, a lawsuit, and a new Penn-
sylvania governor for the Philadelphia Daily
News to secure an electronic list of 82,034 state
employees -- the same information that's been
available to the public for years on microfiche at
the state library in Harrisburg.
Former Gov. Robert P. Casey refused to pro-
vide a computer tape of the state payroll, with no
explanation beyond saying he was satisfied with
the old arrangements. The Daily News sued in
Commonwealth Court and Casey stalled. He left
office in January. His successor, Gov. Tom Ridge,
settled the case by turning over the computer tape
three weeks after taking office.
Pennsylvania reporters remain hampered by a
1957 public records law that doesn't mention
computers, requiring only that public officials
establish "reasonable rules" for providing copies
of public documents. The Allentown Morning
Call's Jack Kraft and David Washburn recently
reported on the trouble this has meant for local
governments, citizen groups and journalists
throughout the state.
Ridge said during his 1994 campaign that if a
government document is considered public when
it's on paper, then the same information should
be accessible to the public in electronic formats,
technology permitting. State legislator Stewart
Greenleaf has sponsored legislation to that ef-
fect. But to become law, it needs approval from
a state Senate that still denies the public even
paper copies of Senate payroll and expense
records.

Yogi Berra might say 90 percent of journalism is half mental
Slice percents right
By Jennifer LaFleur
NICAR Staff

So you went into journalism to avoid math?
For the more nerdy, mathematical formulas
may come as naturally as slipping on a pocket
protector each morning; however, to those just
starting in computer-assisted reporting, math
can be intimidating.
I'm not suggesting that to do computer-as-
sisted reporting you have to have an immediate
grasp of differential equations, but whether you're
looking at hard copy reports from a government
agency or analyzing data in a spreadsheet, you
should be familiar with three key formulas: per-
cent change, percent of total and per capita.
Percent of total
This one is easy to get turned around. The rule
is: the amount divided by the total (amount/
total). For example, if Bob owns 10 animals and
two of those animals are cats, 2 divided by 10(2/
10) or 20 percent of his animals are cats.
Percent change
You're dealing with two years' worth of data
and want to figure percent change from one year
to the next. Take the difference of the two years
divided by the amount from the earlier year. Say
we're looking at 1993-1994 data. The differ-
ence: 2,567-2,345 = 222. Now: 222/2,345 =
0.09.
Per capita
Looking at occurrences by city or county or
state can be interesting. But remember to keep
things on common ground. I can't compare raw
numbers if the "bases" are different. That means
if I'm looking at the number of murders by city
in the United States, Los Angeles and New York
probably will come out on top, but only because
they have more people. A more useful measure
would be per capita murders. In this case, per
capita murders would be the number of murders
divided by population.
Sometimes these measures will be adjusted a
little if the number of occurrences is low. Crime
statistics, for example often are reported per
100,000 or per 10,000 people. These measures
are used because (hopefully) the number of
murders in a city is fairly low compared to the
number of people. The per capita measure might
be 0.0005-yikes! By looking at the figure per
100,000 people, it becomes easier to read: 50
murders per 100,000 people.
When you're trying to figure if persons per
household is households divided by population
or population divided by households. Do one
simple thing: turn your per into a division sign.
This means that persons PER households be-
comes persons/households or population/house-
holds. If that doesn't work, trying narrowing the
field to a few items: for example if I have two
houses and 10 people, how many persons per
household is that? Of course, it's five a house.

9491, or send e-mail to jenster@aol.com

Continued from page one: Meyer's tips
ers can do that getting the Consumer Price
Index issued by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics.
• Watch out for "lurking variables." Journal-
ists often write about how one thing correlates
with another. Meyer believes they should al-
ways check for other variables, and see what
happens when those other variables are held
constant.
For example, he cited stories that rank states
based on Standard Achievement Test scores.
The problem is that, in some places, a smaller
percentage of students take the SAT scores
the college-bound who, overall, post better
scores. Elsewhere, a larger percentage of stu-
dents take the test. By using a simple regres-
sion, reporters could adjust for differences.
• Show a scatterplot. No math here. This
kind of graphic is good for showing relation-
ships. Say you are reporting about how a natural
disaster reaped heavier damage in neighbor-
hoods built during a certain period. Peg the
vertical (y) axis to the year constructed; the
horizontal (x) axis to percent destroyed. Then
plot each block on the graph. The scatterplot
marks each bit of data effectively. Newspapers
don't use scatter blocks enough, Meyer said.
• The chi-square test. What are the odds that
something happened by coincidence? The chi-
square test is a quick way to find out. A variety
of books describe the chi-square test, including
Meyer's The New Precision Journalism.

Crunch those numbers
versy and convince skeptics. It could also pre-
vent costly missteps.
When WCCO-TV in Minneapolis got a state
report on unwed mothers, reporter Aian Cox
double checked the numbers with regression
analyses.
The state suggested poor mothers have more
out-of-wedlock births. Cox said, "I couldn't find
the correlation, and chose to weed that out of my
story."
Cox said he often runs rudimentary regres-
sion analyses to decide how - or whether- to
report a story. The CBS affiliate also uses them
for election returns and exit polls.
"It's very helpful to have some understanding
of sampling techniques," he said. "I think by
having statistical training in that area, you avoid
going out on a limb on election night."
. In television, it's hard to convey numbers.
Cox recommends using graphs. And, he said,
viewers have been enthusiastic.
"We get e-mails: Where did you get those
numbers?" he said. "I think there's a hunger out
there, though maybe not an overwhelming one."

Going back in jail
Sampling techniques are good for more than
just interpreting polls. For a recent story about
why ex-convicts keep going back to prison, Jon
Schmid, assistant database editor with the Ra-
leigh News & Observer, picked a random sample.
"We found who had come back to prison
about 200 people - and we wanted to find out
why," he said. Schmid worked with a reporter
who believed people got back into trouble be-
cause of severe drinking or drug problems.
Because he did not have time to background
all 200 prisoners, Schmid selected a small sample.
He and the reporter checked those prisoners
thoroughly. They found many were indeed sent
back to prison for drug and alcohol-related crimes.
"I buy into the statistical theory that using a
random sample, you can draw an inference,"
Schmid said. "I dont think we could have done
that story based on anecdotal evidence."
Schmid rarely works with correlations and
other high-end statistics because he works mostly
with data based on observations. That makes it
difficult to establish cause and effect. But he
frequently uses what he calls "exploratory statis-
tics" - like cross tabs and graphs - to look for
trends and unusual occurrences.

"They help you to look at data, to go beyond
making a list," he said. "The tools are a compass
that lets me see through the fog of data."
Cross-tabs at work
Sarah Cohen, a St. Petersburg Times business
reporter, also is a fan of cross tabs: those tables
that test two or more variables at once.
"They work out well," she said. "They are
easier to show to editors because you can see
immediately how to tell the story to people."
Cohen, a former government economist, cau-
tioned that some statistical methods may be bet-
ter than others.
"My sense is that people out there can do
(high-end statistics) better than we can," she said.
"I've used these tools for a long time, and I never
saw an economics study you couldn't fight with.
Why should we get in on that in newspapers?"
On the other hand, professional statisticians
are not interested in countless topics, Cohen said.
These areas are full of opportunities for journal-
ists, and often require only simpler statistical
processes.
Instead of ranking schools based on just one
measure, for example, education writers can cre-
ate an index. Then they can take test scores,
spending per pupil, teacher salaries and drop-out
rates into account. Journalists can do this quickly,
and improve stories significantly.
"These are tools that help you sort through a
huge number of different combinations of things,"
she said. "Indexes, cross tabs - (tools) where its
clear what you're talking about when you're fin-
ished."
Schmid agrees that some analyses are better
done on deadline than others.
"Cross tabs are really straight forward," he
said. "(But) when you get into real stats, like
taking a sample and so forth, you have to be really
careful. It's based on some really strict assump-
tions."
Cohen recommends that journalists get com-
fortable with statistics through skepticism and
practice.
"One thing we're not doing well is being as
skeptical of numbers as we are of words," she
said. "We need to remember we're not very
skeptical and think some more."

Cool math tip:
Each year a dollar
loses value. Here's
how to adjust for
inflation. Just look
at the percent
change in the
Consumer Price
Index (CPI) from
one year to the next.
Adjust the earlier
year's sum "up" to
reflect them in
current dollars. It's a
simple
multiplication:
percent change
(expressed in
decimal form, not
percent) times the
older dollar amount.
Add that to the
older figure. Keep in
mind that CPI varies
regionally, so use the
CPI for your area.

On the Internet
When hate builds a bomb
By Nora Paul

When breaking news hits - and rarely does a
story hit harder than the bombing in Oklahoma
-the Internet can be your link to the latest news,
and the most esoteric background materials.
Almost immediately, newspapers, radio and
television stations around the country created
sites with information about the bombing, the
survivors, and the victims. A sampling:
Media organizations
The Edmond (Okla.) Evening Sun had just
started a web site. Soon after the bombing, the
paper posted letters to the editor and a photo
album. http://www.icon.net/sun/index.html
KBIA Radio News (from University of Mis-
souri) started a special report about the bombing
containing audio files of Clinton's and Reno's
statements. It offers a comprehensive list of other
sources on the bombing and its aftermath. http:/
/www.missouri.edu/~jschool/kbia/bombing/
index.html
KOCO-TV in Oklahoma City posted pictures
from the blast site, and has been keeping the
community informed with food bank, and Red
Cross services available for victims. http://
www.ionet.net/koco/index.html
The Raleigh News & Observer has been con-
stantly updating its Oklahoma City bombing
report with photos and news stories. Its list of
links is invaluable. http://www.nando.net/news-
room/nt/bbextra.html
Time Warner's Pathfinder service leads
the pack of news magazines. http://
www.pathfinder.com/
Government agencies
When it comes to covering what should be
done in emergencies, several agencies offer use-
ful information:
The Federal Bureau of Investigation web site
describes the government's reward for informa-
tion about the bombing. It is also the best site for
background information on the continuing
Unabomber attacks. http://naic.nasa.gov/fbi/
Also, the Oklahoma State Government Infor-
mation Server for official state and local reports.
http://www.oklaosf.state.ok.us/
(For more information on Internet sources for
disaster coverage, including the American Red
Cross, Federal Emergency Management Agency
and Emergency Preparedness Information
eXchange, see Nora Paul's Uplink article in the
March 1995 edition.)

Stalking militia groups
When the suspect was caught, and his links to
radical anti-government militias were discov-
ered, finding background and information on the
militia groups became a research priority. Here's
where the Internet could help:

The ftp site (http://www.tezcat.com/patriot/)
"Patriot" includes directories of files on topics
such as Waco / Weaver, Patriotic Justice jour-
nals, historical files, and a timeline of individual
rights "violations" throughout American His-
tory. This site provides great (although, obvi-
ously, biased) background on the issues that
militia groups feel they are dealing with. An-
other collection of links is at http://
www.primenet.com/~lion/data01.html.
They Fight the Right lists groups that provide
research about right-wing organizations, cults,
and hate groups. It's compiled by Political Re-
search Associates. There are some organiza-
tions which may be useful in locating back-
ground information on militias. This is a won-
derful resource with contact information and
other details. The Terrorism Handbook (which
includes a recipe for ammonium nitrite fuel oil
bombs) is often pulled from lists almost as soon
as its posted. (It is, however, still available in the
newsgroup zer.t-netz.pyrotechnik). http://

Not every college offers CAR knowledge
Despite advances in newsrooms, many university jour-
nalism programs have not yet introduced computer-as-
sisted reporting. In a 1993 survey, less than a third taught
on-line searching, and even fewer dealt with databases.
Kevin Lee, an assistant communications professor at
West Virginia Wesleyan College, conducted a blind survey
of more than a dozen experts, asking how to change the
situation. The participants included Elliot Jaspin at Cox
Newspapers; Penny Loeb at U.S. News & World Report,
Steve Ross at Columbia University; and Shawn McIntosh,
Dallas Morning News.
The results are that schools would enhance their reputa-
tions, and students would be better journalists, if more
universities taught computer-assisted reporting. The hurdles
include getting and maintaining good equipment, resis-
tance from school officials, and a lack of qualified teachers.

Internet in a beat
Preston P. Forman, a reporter for the Standard-Times of
New Bedford, Mass., recounted two instances where the
Internet helped his small newspaper get the story in a hurry.
When a television station license was sold, he needed to
find someone at the Federal Communications Commission
an agency he had never covered. He went to http://
www.fcc.gov, found the agency's internal phone directory,
and got the right official quickly.
Another time, there was a dispute over the lack of
accessibility at town buildings for the disabled. He went to
http://www.usdoj.gov, and, a few clicks later, got details on
what the Americans with Disabilities Act means for mu-
nicipalities.

Arizona TV station seeks CAR reporter
KPNX-TV of Phoenix, Ariz., is seeking a reporter with

assisted reporting.

Don't bank on it
The Wall Street Journal recently used computer-as-
sisted reporting to show that big banks - despite ads to the
contrary - don't lend that much to small businesses.
The newspaper studied bank filings (known as call
reports) to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The com-
puter helped the paper sift through almost 12,000 reports,
and help compare small business deals versus overall com-
pany loans.
The newspaper contrasted the numbers with the banks'
advertising claims. It also described how small business
owners face a tough time getting loans, and how analysts
believe the decline of local banking means tougher times
ahead.
