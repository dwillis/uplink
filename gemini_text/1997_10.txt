Globetrottin'
Uplink Update
CAR has not only begun to reach
every area of the newsroom — from
the sports desk to the lifestyles desk
— it has also stretched to every corner of the globe — from Sweden to
Latin America. So, sit back and let
Uplink take you around the world in
pursuit of CAR.
NICAR's Kara Morrison looks at
a variety of computer-assisted
projects in Latin America.
Stefan Lisinski explains how his
Swedish newspaper investigated the
business of bankruptcy.
Also included in this month's issue are updates from Finland and
Denmark.
This issue also takes a look ahead
to what's to come in 1998. We are
currently compiling economic CAR
stories for a future issue but include
a taste of what's to come with Neill
Borowski's explanation of the
Inquirer's property tax investigation.

CAR for all
CAR in Latin America
By Kara Morrison
NICAR
When Carlos Subero decided to attend last year's advanced computer-assisted reporting seminar in Chapel Hill,
he was already an experienced political
reporter in Caracas, Venezuela.
But the knowledge he came home
with led to projects no one else in his
country had tried. The projects included
an analysis of all 257 members of
Venezuela's Congress using SPSS software, and a global study of the increasing number of women in high political
offices. Subero did both analyses for his
newspaper, El Universal, using databases he built from his own research.
"My first important project in CAR
was very profitable," said Subero, who
says he is still the only professional
journalist practicing CAR in Venezuela. But he says the idea is spreading.
Lise Olsen, managing director of
Periodistas de Investigación, IRE's
counterpart in Mexico City, said Subero
is one of several Latin American journalists now embracing the computer as
a powerful reporting tool.
PI trains 40-60 journalists each month
in computer-assisted reporting workshops. Olsen says two main factors are
fueling the trend, the first of which is an
increase in online information.
"It has become fashionable for government offices to have Web sites," she
explained. This has made retrieving
government records easier than having
to request databases from government
public relations offices that often do not
know such information exists.
The second main factor is that other
journalists have been encouraged by
watching some of their colleagues complete successful computer-assisted reporting projects.
"I think more and more people are
trying [CAR], showing people who are
doubtful that it can be done," Olsen said.
Jose Roberto de Toledo is a Brazilian
journalist who has done just that, completing numerous CAR projects for his

Tracking
bankruptcy
By Stefan Lisinski
Dagens Nyheter
How do you tell a story about
bankruptcy as a tool for economic
criminality?
A lot of people, at least in Sweden,
know that bankruptcy is a business
itself with a lot of criminality, but the
trick is to prove it. A lot of people
involved in bankrupt companies are
suspected, some are prosecuted but
only a few are convicted for economical criminality.
I tried to do the story by starting at
the other end.
I made a top list and investigated
the people who are involved in the
biggest number of bankrupt companies.

Continued from page one: South of the border
newspaper, Folha, in Sao Paulo.
After finding numbers compiled by a Brazilian congressman, Toledo used Excel to analyze public works projects in the country by
state, department and type of expense. He then
calculated the amounts spent on each and
compared the amounts to expenditures from
previous years.
Toledo also used data from Sao Paulos Pro-Aim institute to analyze the causes of death in
the city.
He was able to link many homicides to
alcohol abuse. Finally, Toledo used INS data
to track Brazilian emigrants.
He found the five American states that were
their most popular destinations Massachusetts,
New Jersey, Florida, New York and California
and profiled several Brazilians there. Toledo
said each project took about a week.
"The most difficult part," Toledo said, "is
always to find the source of good and reliable
data."

Starting simple
Olsen said most computer-assisted projects
in Latin America are still done using spreadsheets and Internet sources, rather than more
complex databases and statistical analyses.
Francisco Vidal, a reporter with Milenio
magazine in Mexico City and formerly with
the newspaper Reforma's investigative team,
has done several such projects.
Vidal analyzed the economics of Mexican
soccer teams using data he compiled.
He was able to estimate how profitable
each team was.
Another project Vidal did was a spreadsheet analysis of cancer rates among Mexican
women.
He found the rates were higher in some
Northern Mexican states, and that women in
other states were dying less frequently largely
because they had detected cancer earlier.
Olsen said another reporter, Claudia
Fernandez of El Universal in Mexico City,
recently downloaded data from the National
Security Archives Web site.
With this, Fernandez was able to decode
some information about Cold War KGB activities with a code sheet that she also downloaded from the Web site.
She was then able to identify a journalist, a
former politician and other former KGB agents
living in Mexico, one of whom was still alive.
She then interviewed him and the family members of others for a riveting story.

Good with the bad
While Olsen admits Latin American journalists have more problems gaining access to as
much computerized information as American reporters do, she says they do have one advantage.
Olsen said journalists there do not have to deal as
often with translating old 9-track government
tapes, since most government offices in Latin
America use PCs.
And so far, she says, laws in Mexico at least
have not made any distinctions between electronic and print records.
Olsen also said sharing information helps reporters get started with CAR projects, since some
ideas, like exploring campaign finance, analyzing budgets and comparing crime rates, can be
done in almost any country.
"Information sharing is just as important internationally as nationally," she said.
Subero for one doesn't plan to stop learning
about and using computer-assisted reporting. He
is currently working with the Venzuela electoral
institution Consejo Supremo Electoral to ensure
campaign finance data is compiled there.
"I have no experience with Access, Paradox or
Mapinfo, but it is my plan to do it soon."
Subero said Phil Meyer has agreed to travel to
Caracas next November to teach CAR courses.
"This will give you an idea about the importance
that El Universal sees in CAR."
Toledo also said his experience has taught him
much and has given him an edge in a market still
new to computer-assisted reporting.
"Besides the conclusions of the articles themselves, I learned a lot of things doing this job from
operating the software to finding good sources of
data," Toledo said.
"More than that, I learned that the computer is
the best friend of the reporter. Unfortunately, I
believe that CAR is still almost unknown in
Brazil I believe this is going to change in the next
[few] years. Until then, I and a few others will
continue to use CAR techniques to be ahead of the
competitors."

Continued from page one: Filing bankruptcy
I could show that a lot of them had never
actually ran the companies. I could describe the
methods they were using. Criminals or not, that
was for the courts to decide, but the reader got a
picture of companies where the basic idea was
not to sell anything but to fool the authorities and
other companies.
The story was published Oct. 1996 in Dagens
Nyheter, Sweden's biggest morning newspaper.

Story behind the story
For Swedish reporters the story about how I
did the story was just as interesting as the story
itself. This was one of the first times a reporter
could use data from a Swedish authority and run
it in his own computer.
Reporters in my country are used to getting
information from authorities, but only on paper.
Every citizen has a right to read most of the
documents that you can find at the authorities,
both local and national. But when you get to
computers we have rules that look like a joke.
When I asked the Swedish company register
for information on discs about all Swedish joint-
stock companies that filed bankruptcy during
one year, they told me I first needed permission.
After four months, the Swedish Computer
Inspection Authority said Okay. They had trouble
before when a reporter asked for permission to
write a book on a computer and they found that
this was against the law! At that time the Swedish government decided that this was a question
of freedom of the press and gave permission.
This decision helped me and I was one of the
first reporters to get this kind of information on
discs.
This also explains why one of the first CAR
stories in Sweden was about economic criminality. The Swedish company register knows how
to use computers and they are used to selling
information to other authorities and market companies.
Other authorities don't understand what you
are talking about, and they don't know that they
are allowed to provide electronic information.
I guess in a few years this will change.
More Swedish reporters will ask for more
electronic information and the authorities have
to be taught to give us the information. The war
has just started.

Crunching the data
For one year there were more than 18,000
bankrupt companies with about 50,000 members of the boards. The information was 43
megabytes. The newspaper had to pay about
$2,000 for the information. The company registers argued that they had to create a program to
sort out the bankrupt companies.
I used Access, simply because my newspaper already had it, and I didn't think much about
other alternatives.
The computer work was quite easy, even if I
had to learn the program from start. The problem was that I got a lot of different ideas from
the data, and I had to realize that I couldn't make
a story of all of the ideas.
I got a list of people involved in 10 or more
bankruptcies. Total there were 13 people.
Then I started the old-fashioned research
work, looking into documents from courts, trustees reports interviews, etc. This took a long time
and had little to do with CAR work.
A big part of the story was to make a description of all these 13 people. Most of them were
anonymous in the story.
Of the 13 people there were seven who were
what we call goal keepers. These were drug
addicts, thieves and people with no money at all.
They had been put in the companies when it was
time for bankruptcy. Eleven of 13 were involved in police investigations. Only two were
entrepreneurs who had failed in business. I
published an interview with one of them.
Most of the people were in their 40s, 12 were
men and 12 also were of Swedish origin. This
was important since there is a lot of discussions
about immigrants and criminality.
I also found some new interesting examples
of economic criminality. We found a lot of
accountants who were involved in hundreds of
bankruptcies. Some of them were about to loose
their permission to work as accountants.
The conclusion was that there is a lot of
economic criminality in bankruptcies and that
this is a profitable criminality with a good chance
for the criminal to go free. One disappointment
was that I couldn't find the big guys behind the
goal keepers.

Tax Investigation
Analyzing property tax
By Neill A. Borowski
The Philadelphia Inquirer
New Jersey has the highest per-capita property-tax burden in the nation. With this in mind
— and a governor's election in November —
we embarked on a mission to determine what
happened to property taxes in New Jersey.
The target period was 1993, the year before
Gov. Christie Whitman entered office, and
1996, which was the latest year available.
The result was a project in the Aug. 24
Inquirer that I reported and wrote with James
M. O'Neill from our Trenton bureau. We
looked at every residential property in New
Jersey and compared each property's tax bill
between 1993 and 1996. The analysis of more
than 2 million records in each year taxed MS
Access, but SPSS picked up the slack.
However, the important computer-assisted
reporting revelation wasn't how to do a tax
story. The important step was coming up with
a unique economic analysis using CAR tools.
Every reporter with CAR skills and some
knowledge of statistics can put together a
regional economic analysis that may rival similar analyses done by local planning boards,
academics or others.
There may be reluctance to venture into
economics because the subject seems so technical and full of ambiguities. Don't worry.
You can make a contribution.
In our tax piece, we found the median
increase in a residential property tax bill was
about 12 percent between 1993 and 1996.
Yet, Gov. Whitman said state income tax
cuts made up for the increases. That was hard
to pin down, but we used 1989 (1990 census)
median household income statistics to estimate incomes in municipalities in 1993 and
1996. We calculated income tax bills each
year and found the change. In the higher-income communities, the income-tax cut often
made up for the increase in property taxes.
How were those income estimates made?
We turned to the Bureau of Economic
Analysis (U.S. Commerce Department), which
makes wage, salary and personal income estimates for counties. We applied the county-
level income increases from the BEA to the
1989 median household incomes by municipality. We tested the estimates using the CPI
and found the BEA method didn't yield crazy
results. (One key assumption, though, was that
the typical household in a community saw increased income. We noted in the story that if the
household's income were flat between 1993 and
1996, the tax cuts would have been even greater.)

Data sources
Here are some of the sources of regional economic data we used for this story and others
involving regional economic analysis:
• Income data (BEA). A wonderful source is at
http://www.stat-usa.gov. Estimates of personal
income, earnings, wages and salaries are available for states, metros and counties. Unfortunately, there is a subscription fee (no press privileges). The Bureau of Economic Analysis' site is
http://www.bea.doc.gov. This is free and you can
at least get the news releases and maybe some
data. The BEA also makes income projections by
metro area to the year 2045.
• Income data (BLS and Census). Hourly earnings and other data from the Current Population
Survey and other sources available at http://
www.bls.gov, the BLS (U.S. Department of Labor) site. The Census Bureau's income data tends
to be more dated than the BEA's. The site is http:/
/www.census.gov/hhes/www/income.html. The
BLS' Consumer Price Index also is available at
the BLS site.
• Employment data (BLS). Many reporters say
their state labor departments have a lot more data
than BLS. However, in most cases the data
released by state departments originate with the
BLS. The two leading employment series: civilian labor force (residence-based) and payroll
employment (employer-based). The civilian labor force number comes from the Current Population Survey and is used to calculate the unemployment rate. The civilian labor force number is
national, with estimates for the states. For example, total civilian employment in Pennsylvania is the number of Pennsylvania residents who
are employed. By contrast, payroll employment
data (also called "establishment employment" or
"series 790 data") are based on employer location
and not job holder residence. For example, payroll employment in Pennsylvania is the number of
jobs within the state borders - even if residents of
New Jersey fill some of them. The 790 data
typically are available only to the metro area level
Continued on page five

Continued from page four: tax investigation
although the central cities of Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington and New York are released.
The payroll employment data also breaks industries down to sub-industry groups. Local residence-level employment data are available
through the BLS Local Area Unemployment
Statistics (LAUS) program. Some economists
call these numbers the laus-y statistics because
they are gross estimates and probably subject to
a great deal of error (which isn't measured).
However, as questionable as these data are they
are available each month on the county or municipal levels. Finally, the Series 202 data —
now available from state labor departments and
available in the future from the BLS - is based
on a quarterly survey of every employer and
includes wage and employment information. It
is available down to at least the county level (and
is viewed as relatively solid; the BLS uses the
202 numbers to benchmark the 790 numbers).
Some data are available at http://www.bls.gov.
• Businesses (County Business Patterns). The
Census Bureau each year publishes County
Business Patterns, tracking employment, payroll and establishment totals down to four-digit
SIC codes. For example, in 1994 there were 92
video-rental establishments employing 894
people and paying them a total of $10,482,000
a year in Philadelphia. So? You may be studying
the size of one industry versus another. The CBP
series isn't based on surveys, so there is no
sampling error. The Census Bureau uses administrative records for CBP. However, there is a
lag. The latest available, 1994, was released last
fall.
A problem is that the bureau withholds some
data if information about one employer might be
disclosed. This becomes common when you
move to three- or four-digit SIC codes or you
concentrate on smaller counties in your analysis. Find out more at http://www.census.gov/
epcd/cbp/view/cbpview.html. Complete reports
are available for download by state using Acrobat Reader (pdf files).
• Economic Censuses. While we know a bit
about local businesses from County Business
Patterns, the Census Bureau's economic censuses can fill in some of the "holes." The
censuses of Retail Trade, Wholesale Trade,
Services, Services/Tax-Exempt, FIRE (Finance,
Insurance and Real Estate), Manufacturing,
Mining and Construction show the number of
establishments, annual receipts and number of
employees. Theses censuses come out for years
ending in "2" and "7." For information: http://
www.census.gov/epcd/www/92results.html.
• Gross output. We all know that Gross
Domestic Output (GDP) measures the output of
goods and services for the national economy.
However, there is GDP available at a state level,
called appropriately Gross State Product. The
database is simple: the total output of goods and
services down to two-digit SIC code for each
state. "Output" in this case is the value added to
the good or service by an industry within a state.
Because it is a value-added measure, there is no
double counting (for example, the value of raw
materials brought into Pennsylvania to make a
product would not be counted in Pennsylvania's
output).
• State/Local government finances/taxes. The
Census Bureau's government page at http://
www.census.gov/govs/www/index.html is overflowing with useful statistics. Included are 1992
through 1996 state tax collection data, state and
local government finances from 1991 through
1994, financial information for larger counties
and 1992 through 1995 state government payrolls.
• Federal tax data. The IRS' Statistics of
Income (SOI) program has a useful site packed
with tax statistics at http://www.irs.gov/
tax_stats/index.html. Besides the statistics, you
can download the IRS tax-exempt organizations file by state. Links to state tax departments
are available at http://www.irs.gov/prod/
forms_pubs/ftaframes.html. Other tax-related
sites are available at http://www.irs.gov/prod/
forms_pubs/ftaframes.html.
• Other local economic data. Each state has a
data center affiliated with the Census Bureau.
The links to these centers is at http://www
.census.gov/sdc/www/.If you rummage through
your data center's site, you can come up with
local economic statistics, building permits and
other useful data.

Handout of the Month
Covering Housing
By George Rodrigue
The Dallas Morning News
In this handout, George Rodrigue gives a
variety of tips for covering public housing.
The IRE Resource Center has several handouts and stories dealing with public housing.
To order any of these files, call (573) 882-3364.

1. Look under your own nose.
Public Housing segregation in East Texas
Everybody knew that public housing in
rural East Texas was segregated.
Anyone could drive into pretty much any
small town and see two projects: One white
and well-tended, and the other black and decrepit.
What Craig Flournoy and I did, twelve
years ago now, is stop and ask why.
Public housing authority directors said
things like, "If you let black kids and white
kids grow up together, they might like each
other. And then you know what you'd have?
Race mixing!"
The same pattern, in different guises, was
equally obvious in other rural areas. Not to
mention the big cities. Urban renewal had
razed hundreds of inner-city neighborhoods,
usually occupied by minorities but almost all
of them poor.
The occupants were herded into high-rises
and, quite often, denied chances to move to
neighborhoods with lower poverty rates and
more jobs.
Why?
Some public officials confessed that racism played a role, as did the convenience of
politically connected developers.
In other words, "ghettos" didn't just happen. They were subsidized by the federal government.

2. Examine the files.
HUD had known about problems in East
Texas, and elsewhere, for decades.
Next question: Discrimination had been
illegal for 20 years. Why did HUD fail to
intervene? We FOIA'd pretty much every HUD
inspection file of East Texas public housing
authorities.
The agency had known about the authorities'
bigoted directors for decades. It had them on the
record opposing "race mixing." Yet it had done
nothing.
Privately owned but HUD-subsidized projects
showed the same pattern.
Odd, because federal law required HUD to
ensure that projects in non-minority residents.
Time after time, we found HUD had approved
marketing rules that specified a goal of "zero"
recent minorities.
When we called the former HUD regional
administrator for comment he said, "It looks like
we didn't give a damn about those regulations,
and we didn't."
Last piece of the record chase: When Housing
and Urban Development delayed providing us
with certain reports, The Dallas Morning News
asked the agency to send us copies of the docket
cards listing the name and phone number of every
attorney who had filed suit against the agency for
civil-rights violations.
That led to warehouses full of HUD documents those lawyers had obtained, including depositions with city officials around the country
who'd taken federal funds designed to "free" poor
people, and used the money to ghettoize them.

3. Reverse-engineer the bureaucracy.
Computer-aided inspection of Dallas Housing
Authority waiting list drew quick confession.
Like most big cities, Dallas' public housing
has long been segregated.
The Dallas Housing Authority's leaders, however, denied deliberately "steering" of applicants
to particular projects.
By law, the authority must maintain a waiting
list that tracks each applicant, noting that
applicant's race and the projects that each applicant is offered.
We cross-tabulated the race of the applicant
with the racial composition of the projects the
tenants were offered.
Whites almost always got offered "white"
projects; blacks almost always were offered
"black" projects.
I called back the staff person who was responsible for making these offers and told her there
was less than a one-in-ten-thousand chance of this
being mere coincidence.

Continued from page six:
Housing handout
She confessed then and there that the agency
was "trying to make people offers for places it
knew they'd like." This was illegal, she knew,
but she said her bosses required her to follow
this policy.
Other things to look for in waiting lists:
People who jump ahead of others on the list, or
never get called for apartments. That can be a
sign of favoritism, or prejudice.
Every agency has to keep certain records,
whether by law, regulation, or common-sense
necessity. Find those records and use them to
reverse-engineer the agency's real operating
patterns.
Also with HUD, we created a national database of public housing occupancy by race. We
applied HUD's own criteria for segregation
within a public housing authority, and found
that the overwhelming majority of housing authorities were segregated.

4. Huge, immensely promising projects
bear especially close scrutiny.
Empowerment and Enterprise Zones
Years ago Dallas' Crow Companies got $4
million in Housing and Urban Development
grants to create 2,000 jobs for Hispanics in the
impoverished West Dallas area. Time passed,
the project was built, the federal funds were
disbursed.
Net result: 16 jobs for West Dallas Hispanics. Each with a federal subsidy of $250,000.
The history of even grander schemes, such as
"empowerment zones" and "enterprise communities," contains many tales of more grandiose flops. HUD and the Congressional Republicans share an ideological bias toward these
kinds of programs, however, so they never
really die. Keep an eye on them, and compare
participants' contractual promises to what they
actually deliver.
Bear in mind, also, that previous studies
have found these zones mostly shift development around a bit within a city, without fundamentally altering development dynamics in the
region.

5. But then, so do routine business transactions.
Landlords with HUD Section 8 subsidized
projects often take the money and run.
Here's a scandal so blatant HUD recently
called a press conference to denounce it.
Too many landlords whose projects carry
HUD Section 8 subsidies have been pocketing
the federal checks but then declining to pay their
mortgage holders, or to spend money on maintenance.
Because of the weak way Congress wrote the
laws, HUD must continue sending those checks
even after the landlord declares bankruptcy —
leaving HUD to pay mortgage insurance. As a
result of such "skimming," taxpayers are stuck
with bad debts on decrepit projects, and tenants
live in hell-holes.
HUD local or regional offices may be willing
to provide information under FOIA, about
projects where maintenance is particularly bad
and where landlords may be in default on their
loans.
Another routine problem: Housing and Urban Development guarantees loans up to $25,000
to lower-income people needing home renovations.
But it also lets contractors handle the loan
paperwork. This is an invitation to fraud, and
HUD has found plenty.
Builders get folks in debt they can't manage
and then flee, often leaving shoddy or half-finished work behind.

6. Connections matter.
Welfare reform will affect the lives of everyone in public housing, driving up rents and,
perhaps, leaving more kids unattended.
Public housing doesn't work in isolation.
Changes in food stamp and welfare laws will
cause huge changes.
Some families will become better off (and
face higher rents, and may leave.)
Others will become even poorer.
Some face benefit cuts.
Others must cope with sporadic employment
or face new costs for transportation, health and
child care — especially after they lose the single
year of "transitional” benefits guaranteed them
by most states.
And as millions of mothers are pushed into
the workforce, who'll be watching the children?

Around the Globe
International Wrap-up
By Brant Houston
IRE Executive Director
Spurred by the wealth of information on the
Internet and the sharing of techniques by their
U.S. colleagues, journalists in other countries
are quickly catching up on CAR.
This month we will conduct a border workshop for U.S. and Mexican journalists in Juarez.
The workshop, set up by IRE's Mexico division, will be a bilingual excursion into CAR
and traditional investigative techniques.
In the next six months, IRE and NICAR
trainers will travel to Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Germany, Peru and England.
In Sweden and Finland, IRE and NICAR
this month will train journalists not only in the
basics, but also in the wise use of statistical
methods. In Denmark, IRE and NICAR will
hold another weeklong boot camp in March
before joining Swedish journalists at their annual investigative conferences. In Germany
this January, we will provide training for the
staff of Stars and Stripes while also reaching
out to German journalists.
In Peru, NICAR and its fellow division,
IRE Mexico (Periodistas de Investigacion)
will do an "exploratory" visit next month to
Lima to make plans for seminars for Peruvian
journalists that will take place next year both in
Missouri and Lima.
And in England, IRE and NICAR will help
conduct an all-day training session at a new
media conference in London in July. Last year
trainers from the U.S. spoke and taught at the
conference that combined panels and training.
For the 1998 conference, organizers plan to
have one day of panels and a separate day of
training. We are customizing lessons and data
especially for foreign journalists in order to
make it as relevant as possible.
Meanwhile, we continue to receive numerous inquiries and visits from other foreign
journalists. A Fulbright scholar from Spain is
currently doing a study on CAR here at Missouri. Earlier this year another Fulbright scholar
from Venezuela attended both our basic and
advanced boot camps while working with CAR
pioneer James Brown at the University of
Indiana in Indianapolis.
At another boot camp, we had a working
journalist from Argentina who wants to set up
CAR workshops there. A New Zealand journalists is currently using E-mail to arrange a tour
later this year of campuses and news organizations doing CAR.
At the same time, IRE and NICAR hope to
help the Center for Public Integrity in Washington D.C. in its new project to put together an
international consortium of international journalists.
So, as you can see, International CAR is really
moving ahead.

Finland update
By Jennifer LaFleur
San Jose Mercury News
In spite of weak (or a complete lack) of open
record laws, some European journalists are pioneering computer-assisted reporting in their own
countries.
Much like the pioneers in the United States
(particularly those at small to medium size news
organizations) these journalists are breaking
ground by being the first to ever request raw data
from government agencies — and in some cases,
they're getting them.
YLE, public broadcasting of Finland, has also
begun training television, radio and teletext reporters in using computers at its Radio and Television Institute in Helsinki. In January and October of this year, NICAR did hands-on sessions at
the Institute. Heikki Hiilamo, a YLE investigative reporter and NICAR boot camp attendee has
been leading the charge there. Hiilamo, currently
on leave from the company, helped develop the
October training session.
The difference in the January and October
sessions was notable. Fewer participants expressed concern with not being able to get information from the government and more of the
participants had used the Internet regularly as a
reporting tool. Two of the reporters even came to
the October class with economic data they had
acquired and wanted to analyze.
In some cases, databases - such as tax information on individuals — is more readily available in Finland than in the United States. And the
same techniques we use for building databases

from paper records (especially in smaller communities) can be used in countries where an
electronic database might not be available.
Finland has one CAR advantage: It is a
country that embraces technology with a higher
rate of Internet connections than most U.S.
cities. (With the exception of the text being in
Finnish, many Helsinki billboards bear a resemblance to Silicon Valley.)
Most government agencies in Finland put
information on the Internet. As is happening in
the U.S., the government is providing information in Adobe Acrobat files that are not easily
transferred to a database or spreadsheet and as in
the U.S., reporters are faced with retyping the
information into their computers. Among the
government agencies providing databases in a
useful format are:
• The bank of Finland (www.bof.fi) provides
downloadable economic databases. (And also
provides information in English for all of us
non-Finnish speakers.
• Statistics Finland (www.statfin.fi) is their
Census Bureau — plus more.
• European Forest Institute (www.efi.
joensuu.fi/) provides logging and forestry information.
In addition many European universities provide useful research data on their Web sites.
Reporters in Finland are also realizing what
other journalists outside the United States have
found that data from U.S. agencies also can be
valuable. Stat-USA (www.stat-usa.com) for
example, provides information about imports
and exports by country.
We'll have another report soon since NICAR
is visiting Finland in November.

Denmark Update
By Gwen Carleton
The Capital Times
In Denmark, a land of powerful government
that keeps it databases closed, journalists are
using CAR to shed light on their leaders' effectiveness and learn more about its people.
In recent months, the country's largest national daily newspaper, Jyllands Posten, has
focused on the effectiveness of the country's
supreme court.
The 18 appointed justices have many side
jobs, the paper found, so journalists used CAR
to analyze each justice's workload, number of
cases and decisions, as well as the amount of
time spent on cases.
The paper also has written about moonlighting legislators in the national parliament, and
has published a list of legislators' side jobs on its
Web site.
"CAR has been deeply involved in a number
of lead stories," said Nils Mulvad, a Jyllands
Posten business reporter and graduate of
NICAR's boot camp. "There have been a number of consequences politically, and on the court
system's efforts to improve effectiveness — a
number of votes concerning these issues are
now being discussed."
A consortium of Danish journalists and journalism educators also continue their efforts to
unlock the nation's detailed and sophisticated
governmental databases.
The country's tradition of zero access and the
public's own reluctance to open such information has hindered the effort thus far. But journalists say encouraging signs are beginning to
appear.
In response to pressure from the consortium,
for example, the government has agreed to standardize rules for access to information in its
various branches, something members say constitutes a small but important step forward.
"It's the character of the information that
should decide access, not where the information
is hidden," Mulvad, who also is a consortium
member, said. "The government has now accepted that."
In the seven months since NICAR held its
first boot camp in Denmark, Jyllands Posten
also has used CAR to analyze city demographics in advance of various city elections, and has
expanded its Internet version of the paper. As
other journalists nationwide jump on the bandwagon, Mulvad said, Jyllands Posten's CAR
reporters are receiving increasingly frequent
requests for lectures and training.
"Where there was uncertainty over the new
methods when NICAR was here, now that attitude is gone," he said. "The CAR machine is
working."

Tech Tip
Making data entry easy
By Richard Mullins
NICAR
Sometimes the data you want is only on
paper, but you really want to analyze it in a
database.
So, even though data entry is the proverbial
pain, you decide to do it.
If you're lucky, you can get some help on
the data entry.
But even if you do, make sure you do some
of the entry yourself - a couple dozen records
is probably enough to give you an idea of the
judgments that have to be made when reading
forms and typing some value in a particular
field.
Furthermore, whether you do it all or have
some help, you should create some scheme to
make it possible to quickly and unmistakably
match an individual record on the paper to the
corresponding row that was entered in the
table.

Access assistance
Microsoft Access has some features to make
this easy.
When you design the table and specify the
field names and types, add two more fields to
track data entry: one to show the sequence of
the data entry, the other to show the time the
row was entered.
After you create these fields, they require
no extra effort on your part, and they can come
in very handy.
I'll talk about how to do it first, then the
ways you might use the fields.
For the sequence indicator, make a field
called seq or sequence.
For the data type, choose AutoNumber (in
Access version 2, it's called Counter.) The first
row will have the number 1 in this field, 2 for
the second row and so on.
The field increments the next value automatically.
Once the number is there for a row, it
doesn't change.
Deletions from the table do not renumber
the field and you can't modify it.
If your data doesn't have a unique identifier
for each case or row, this field makes a good
choice. And if your data does have a unique
identifier, the sequence field requires no effort on
your part and it explicitly shows the order of data
entry.
For the data entry time, make a field called
EntryTime or RowTimeStamp. For data type,
choose Date/Time.
The bottom part of the Table Design view is
where you specify properties for a field.
In the property called default value, type the
word Now.
You might notice that when you click somewhere else on the screen, Access adds parentheses to the end of the word that you typed.
This is a sort of automatic syntax-checking.
Access guesses (correctly) that you want to
call the built-in function Now(), which returns
the time and date according to your computer.
After you save the table and start entering
data, you have two fields that Access is filling in
for you: the sequence and the date/time.

Extra entry tips
When planning and assigning the data entry,
break it up into small manageable batches, especially if there are more than a few hundred records
to work with.
When a batch is done (say 50 records), log
who did it and when, and file the paper originals
by batch.
With this filing and entry system, coupled
with the entry-tracking fields Access is handling
for you, you'll have an unambiguous way to
match and audit your work.
Here is an example use for the sequence field.
Say you're typing in questionnaire responses.
Instruct all the people doing the data entry to
write the sequence number generated by Access
on the piece of paper containing the data.
If there is a question about the integrity or
accuracy of a particular row in the table, you can
find the paper original.
The timestamp field will help if you need to
look at all the records that were entered, say, on
Tuesday afternoon, or all the records entered
from Friday onward.

On the Internet
Around the world on the Web
By Nora Paul
The Poynter Institute
"One goal of computer-assisted reporting is
to help make the local global and the global
local," according to Brant Houston, our fearless
IRE/NICAR leader. How can Internet resources
help do this on a timely, comprehensive, credible basis, ie: on deadline?!
Here is a listing of some resources with great
compilations of international resources that can
help bring a broader perspective to your reporting. Because, as we all know, we are no longer
just citizens of our respective countries, we are
members of a global village.
Often the best source is to find a good "scout"
page, a page of links that is well organized and
contains the key resources. Here are some good
listings of International Links:
• European Journalism Page
http://www.demon.co.uk/eurojournalism/
They have a set of links relevant to breaking
stories as well as links organized by government
and politics, the media, and organizations.
• The World-Wide Web Virtual Library: International Affairs Resources
http://www.pitt.edu/~ian/ianres.html
Well organized by types of resources, by
source of the information, and by topics.

International statistics
• CIA World Factbook
http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/nsolo/
wfb-all.htm
A great compilation of statistics and country
profiles.
• International Data Base
http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idbnew.html
"Statistical tables of demographic, and socioeconomic data for all countries of the world."
Check out the "population pyramid" feature for
countries.

http://ssda.anu.edu.au/other/other_archives.html
A page of links, by country, to national data
archive collections.

International news
What are the big stories? Check out local
media coverage of breaking news after finding
them in one of these online news directories:
• One World
www.oneworld.org
"A community of over 150 leading global
justice organizations" compiles news items from
around the world, nicely searchable and focused
on human rights issues.
• ReliefWeb
http://wwwnotes.reliefweb.int:81
Keep up with coverage of international natural disasters and the current status of "complex
emergencies" with this Web site from the United
Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs.

International directories
• Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of
Foreign Governments
http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/chiefs/
chiefs-toc-view.html
If you need the name of the Minister of Education in Niger, head for this page, brought to you
by those friendly folks at the CIA. They provide
links to listings of all the government officials,
with the date it was updated clearly marked.
Unfortunately, doesn't give any contact or e-mail
information.
• The Embassy Page
http://www.embpage.org/index.html
Fighting breaks out in Cyprus and you want
the American Embassy's take?
Go to their Web site (and find all countries'
embassy sites with this listing).

International organizations
• NATO: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization
http://www.nato.int
It only has 16 members, but for those members, there is a handy chart linking you to the
