Starting Small
Uplink Update
For those of you who have been using the excuse "we're too small to do CAR," this issue of Uplink will not be a welcome sight. It is full of examples of how reporters at small papers have scraped together the re- sources to do some hard-hitting in- vestigations.

Sometimes that meant doing the work at home, as was the case for Loraine Anderson of the Traverse City Record-Eagle.

Sometimes it meant joining with other papers to pool resources. NICAR's Joanna Kakissis looks at how some papers have started coali- tions to help fight for data.

Geoff Dutton of The News-Her- ald tells how his paper used comput- ers to investigate tax abatements.

Daniel J. Foley from the Univer- sity of Tennessee tells how his stu- dents graded area schools.

And Jim Toler, a reporter at The Free Lance-Star, shares the lessons he learned doing his first CAR projects.

Compact CAR
Getting by on a shoestring
By Loraine Anderson
Traverse City Record-Eagle
We don't have a CAR post at the Traverse City Record-Eagle. It would be a luxury we couldn't afford. We have 11 reporters to cover our 13 mostly rural counties in northwestern Lower Michi- gan. We have a daily circulation of about 26,000 and a Sunday circulation of 40,000. I am the regional editor and oversee our project reporting as well as our theme beats: business, environment/ health, family/education.

Our newspaper recomputerized a year ago, so we are set up beautifully for CAR. We are now completely PC-based in our newsroom with e-mail on all computers. We have Internet access on five of the PC-120 terminals in the news- room. None of these computers are loaded with spreadsheet or database management software, except for the elementary spreadsheet functions avail- able in Microsoft Word. We do have Excel and Access loaded on computers elsewhere in the building (business de- partment and in the office of our weekly newspaper), so we can take disks to those machines and work with them.

The challenge now is to learn how to maximize the use of our computer sys- tem. I've picked it up because CAR has so many applications for a small news- paper with a small staff and large cover- age area.

I'm trying to do three things: get myself up to speed so that I can work efficiently with databases; determine for management what our newsroom needs so that we can gather and analyze data more conveniently; build a front-end system for our databases so that our reporters can easily access the informa- tion without having to know the ins and outs of Access and Excel.

Most of our CAR work so far has been quite elementary, designed to teach me how to efficiently use Access and Excel so that I can know it well enough to share it with the reporters. I have both

Papers help start CAR

When David Cuillier, an editor at a small daily in Washington state, decided to form a computer-assisted reporting network for journalists in his state two years ago, he was listening — in exasperation — to members of the governor's task force debate limiting access to records.

"I was the only reporter there," says Cuillier, assistant city editor of the Tri-City Herald in Kennewick, Wash. "The state had already closed records for gun permits a while ago... I realized then that if more people were asking for data, the

Tax abatements
Abatement analysis
Geoff Dutton
The News-Herald (Willoughby, Ohio)
Computer-assisted reporting magnifies ev-
erything, for good and for ill.

A previously indistinguishable mess of
details will suddenly zoom into focus, often
revealing surprising trends. At the very least,
CAR can generate solid numbers to accurately
gauge and explain already perceived trends.
That's why I got into it.
Veterans of CAR also had repeatedly
warned me about a downside — the tedium
involved in database reporting. Seeing the
phenomenal results of their work, however, I
was willing to endure.

Still, my biggest CAR disappointment —
one I was not prepared for — came recently,
after months of compiling a database for my
first larger scale CAR project.

Industrial and commercial tax abatements
were the subject. They had become common-
place over the years within The News-Herald's
territory of eastern suburban Cleveland. Even
The News-Herald had received a big one.

The property tax cuts are given by local
municipalities to encourage development, re-
tention of existing businesses and job growth.

Never had the program been independently
and comprehensively analyzed locally. But
the individual tax cuts had been monitored on
the local, county and state level since 1994.

I wanted to compile the various individual
reports, plug them into a spreadsheet and de-
termine the impact of the tax cuts. How many
tax dollars have been forgone? How much
have businesses invested? How many jobs
have been created? How much do those jobs
pay? Which companies weren't living up to
their promises?

Unfortunately, my conclusion — after
months of hard work — was that flimsy data
precluded a solid evaluation.

As it turned out, it wasn't a dead end. The
predicament just forced a new approach to the
story.

I made a list of roughly a dozen interesting
story angles and disparate conclusions. With
the help of an insightful editor, I grouped the
pieces into what would become a five-part
series.

Ironically, one of the strongest parts of the
series focused on my biggest stumbling block—
the lack of credible data. It became a topic for the
final day of the series.
The series broke down this way:

Day I
The headline perfectly captured the essence of
the first part: "Movers and Takers." It focused on
companies that were given tax abatements to
relocate.

There had been 70 tax abatements granted in
Lake County since the program began in 1990,
forgiving more than $56 million in taxes. Most of
the 70 tax breaks were to help companies expand.
But of the 23 given to bring in new companies, an
obvious pattern existed.

Most of the relocating companies — 18, to be
exact—had moved from one local community to
another. Nine of those 18 actually moved within
the county. As it turned out, some communities
felt they were being caught in a tax abatement
"bidding war" with their neighbors.

Day 2
The second part focused on a little-known
type of tax abatement called Community Rein-
vestment Areas. In 1977, Ohio authorized com-
munities to create CRAs, within which all real
estate improvements are tax exempt for 15 years.
The intent was to encourage the improvement of
inner-city housing.

But CRAs can be used on all types of develop-
ment.

They don't attract controversy, though, be-
cause they are handled solely by administrators.
They don't require legislative approval, so the
public never hears about them.

I gathered information from each community
and created a separate countywide database for
CRAs. There were 71 in Lake County exempting
more than $4 million in taxes. A large pending
deal with one company would double that amount.

Day 3
Part three focused on the perception of local
school districts, which rely heavily on property
taxes but have no authority over cities granting
the property tax breaks.

Some were predictably opposed to abatements.
Others were not, noting that the abatements are

state wouldn't be so quick to close things down."

The Washington connection
Shortly after the meeting, Cuillier called ev-
ery one of the 23 newspapers in the state, speak-
ing with reporters who were interested in obtain-
ing and using computerized data in their publi-
cations.

About 10 of the newspapers Cuillier con-
tacted have become regular contributors to the
CAR network, which Cuillier has named
"CARwash."

By mid-August, Cuillier plans to have a Web
site with information about the network as well
as a library of CAR stories done in Washington
state.

"It's helped a couple of papers get rolling on
using CAR in smaller stories and building up to
using it in bigger projects," he said.

Joining forces in Wisconsin
Smaller newspapers face high costs and lim-
ited resources when trying to incorporate com-
puter-assisted reporting and often don't have the
money or time to fight extended public informa-
tion battles.

As a result, several journalists from small
newspapers — and even journalists from news-
paper corporations like Knight Ridder — have
formed networks to coordinate CAR training
and data acquisition.

In Wisconsin, journalists from the Associ-
ated Press and the Wisconsin State Journal have
joined forces with other state reporters and edi-
tors to acquire state data in electronic form, have
a third party clean up the data and then distribute
it to members of the informal CAR network in
the state at significantly reduced prices.

"So far, this (consortium) hasn't had a regu-
lar meeting schedule," said Andy Hall, an inves-
tigative reporter with the Wisconsin State Jour-
nal and a founding member of the state's CAR
network. "It's just been an erratic series of phone
calls and faxes . . . But we've made progress.

"We're in the process right now of acquiring
a huge database from the state department of
transportation listing traffic accidents in the past
seven years. . . Information like this could be
used for anything from in-depth projects to
quick hits."

Cross-country connection
That CAR methods could help enhance both
spot and investigative coverage in part moti-
vated executives at Knight Ridder news service
to sponsor a CAR network for all their newspa-
pers.

The newspaper chain currently sponsors
KRICAR, the Knight Ridder, Inc. Computer
Assisted Reporting Task Force.

KRICAR's coordinator, the Philadelphia
Inquirer's Neill Borowski, said the task force's
goal is to nurture a "big brother, big sister"
program where bigger newspapers whose jour-
nalists are already trained in CAR techniques
help journalists from smaller Knight-Ridder
papers.

"We want to create a network where small
newspapers don't feel intimidated by calling
the bigger newspapers and asking questions
about computer-assisted reporting and analy-
sis," said Borowski, who heads CAR work at
the Inquirer. "And so far, it seems to be work-
ing.

"About once a month, we get calls from
smaller papers and journalists who want to
know if we have any suggestions on subjects
ranging from data analysis or to how to do
certain queries."

KRICAR also operates a listserv that is
accessible to all Knight-Ridder papers.

Any questions about data acquisition or
analysis can be posted to this list as well, said
Borowski.

An Inquirer news researcher recently used
the list to distribute Uniform Crime Report data
— which she had converted into spreadsheet
form — to Knight Ridder newspapers. Two
newspapers — one large and one small —
scooped their competition because of access to
that information, said Borowski.

Continued from page one: Cultivating CAR
Access and Excel on my computer at home,
where I've done a lot of the work. It's meant an
incredible amount of my own time, but I don't
mind too much because I'm teaching myself.

Here are some of the things we have done:
Congressional campaign finance
Our biggest CAR project this year has been
the campaign finance records for our three
congressional districts and six state legislative
districts for the 1994-96 election cycle.

Last fall, I used the American University
site to download congressional data and
spent many a weekend cleaning the data and
checking business directories and Web sites
so that I could correctly categorize them
using codes listed in Larry Makinson's book,
"Follow the Money," published by the Cen-
ter for Responsive Politics, which has an
excellent Web site.

This enabled me later to do sorts to find out
how various special interest groups — health,
oil and gas, etc. — gave to our congressional
leaders. I did the number crunching and gave
them, as well as the assignment, to the reporter
who had two days to report and write his story.
Our stories were quite basic because we didn't
have enough time to analyze the data and
question some of the donations.

State campaign finance
Getting the data for the state representatives
was more involved because Michigan's elec-
tion data are not online. It all had to be typed
and categorized.

We used information found at the FECInfo
page (www.tray.com), looking up all of the
over $200 contributors by ZIP code and sifting
through the information for anyone who gave
more than $5,000. This provided not only an
interesting story, but the beginning of a better
understanding of the politics and business of
our coverage area.

We also have downloaded state health sta-
tistics, school proficiency scores and EPA Toxic
Release Inventory figures for in-depth reports.
I also have all of the 13-county demographic
information on disk in Excel files, plus area tax
base statistics obtained from county equaliza-
tion offices and area construction permits ob-
tained from county building departments.

My long-term goal for all this information is to
build a front-end system and get it networked into
our newsroom computers so that our reporters
can easily use it without having to understand all
the ins and outs of Access and Excel. I am in the
process of learning how to do that now, using
Baltimore Sun's electronic news editor Mike
Himowitz's front-end tutorial, which I down-
loaded from his site (http://www.clark.net/pub/
mikeh/mike/car.htm). In order to do this, I've
needed to learn more of the intricacies of Access,
so I am currently going through the Que Access
95 Tutor book and CD.

Tips
If you are from a small newspaper and want to
learn CAR, here are some things that will help:

• A real desire to learn CAR and a willingness
to spend lots of your own time and possibly even
some of your own money. I attended the week-
long NICAR boot camp at the University of
Missouri in May 1996. Though our editor and
publisher are supportive of CAR, I had to pay for
it myself because there is little money for training.

• Have patience, but be diligent. You can't
learn everything overnight, but you have to keep
at it. Learn what is in front of you and the next part
will make itself clear to you. When I started out,
I surfed a lot, finding and bookmarking sites that
would be good research sources for data, report-
ing projects and editorials.

• If you don't have it, get good spreadsheet and
database manager software on a computer with
Internet access. I got Access and Excel because
our office word processing is Microsoft Word
and our systems people were most familiar with
that.

• Get on the NICAR listserv and monitor it
daily.

• Find other CAR sites that explain some of the
basics. In addition to the handouts page at
NICAR's site (http://www.nicar.org), I've learned
a lot at these sites: Mike Himowitz's Home Page
(http://www.clark.net/pub/mikeh/mike/
mikehome.htm), the Detroit Free Press training
tips page (http://www.freep.com/jobspage/acad-
emy/intel.htm), CAR/CARR (http://www.

Class Project
Students rank schools
By Daniel J. Foley
University of Tennessee, Knoxville
A public affairs reporting class got some
"real world" publishing experience and a weekly
newspaper got a special report it normally
wouldn't be able to produce when the two
combined on a database study of a Tennessee
school system.

The joint effort by the School of Journalism
at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and
the 9,000-circulation LaFollette Press resulted
in the May 29 publication of an eight-page
special tabloid section on schools in Campbell
County.

The headlines on stories written by the 10
students in my senior-level journalism class
convey the flavor of their "report card" on the
school district:

• "Campbell schools, students rank among
lowest in state"

• "Absenteeism is highest in state"

• "Test scores: Student trail statewide aver-
ages"

• "Value added: Schools aren't making the
grade"

• "Schools get extra $$$ from state..."

• "... But test scores, salaries low"

• "Low scores may be linked to poverty"

• "None of county's elementary schools ac-
credited"

• "Success in college? Scores say no"

• "Success at work? It's same story"

The students spent five weeks of a 15-week
semester learning to use a spreadsheet, analyz-
ing a database compiled by the Tennessee De-
partment of Education, interviewing school of-
ficials and then writing, critiquing and rewriting
their stories.

The state's 21st Century Report Card data-
base includes more than 300 columns of infor-
mation on each of the state's 139 school districts
— on such topics as achievement test scores,
local funding resources, state aid, per-pupil
spending, average teacher salaries, demograph-
ics, attendance and accreditation.

Similar data are available in many states, so
the project methodology undoubtedly could be
used elsewhere. The journalism students used
Excel 5.0 on Macs to examine the database, but
any good spreadsheet will work. The primary
database skill used on this particular project was
sorting and ranking school districts in various
categories.

One of the challenges was to identify which
category would give the best overall assessment
of the district. It is well-known that student
achievement on standardized tests in any school
district usually reflects the socioeconomic
makeup of that district. Students who come
from wealthy families with well-educated par-
ents generally score higher than students who
come from poor families with lesser-educated
parents, regardless of the quality of the schools.

Tennessee, like many other states, has imple-
mented a program to measure school impact on
student learning, apart from such socioeconomic
factors. The "value-added" assessment system,
which was designed by a statistics professor at
the University of Tennessee, measures each
student's progress from year to year.

Results of the value-added assessment have
been interesting. In some school districts, stu-
dents do well on achievement tests, but never-
theless don't make the expected progress from
year to year. In other districts, test scores are
comparatively low, but students nevertheless
make better-than-average progress.

One of the things UTK students tried to
determine was which school districts do the best
on both student achievement and school perfor-
mance. Here is how they used the data to do the
rankings:

• Student achievement: Tennessee Com-
prehensive Assessment Program test scores are
now available for seven grades (second through
eighth) in five subjects – reading, language,
mathematics, science and social science. Each
districts' percentile scores for those 35 grade-
subject areas were added and districts were then
ranked from highest to lowest. Campbell County
students ranked 107th of 134 districts. (Five
districts were not included because they do not
have all grades from second to eighth.)

• School performance: Value-added scores,
based on student progress as a percentage of
national norms, are now available in five subject
areas. Each districts' five scores were added and
districts were then ranked from highest to low-
est. The Campbell County system ranked 119th.

• Overall ranking: Rankings for student
achievement and school performance were then

Continued from page five: Grading area schools
combined and districts were ranked based on
the combined score. Campbell County ranked
124th.

The district's poor showing on both student
achievement and school performance and its
even worse overall ranking provided a theme
for the special section. Each student was as-
signed to evaluate data from a specific portion
of the database and to determine how Campbell
County did in each category. One student, for
example, examined data on dropouts, absen-
teeism, suspensions, expulsions and promo-
tions. Her key finding may help explain the
district's low overall ranking: students in the
upper grades in Campbell County had the
highest rate of absenteeism in the state.

The students used several benchmarks for
purposes of comparison:

• The district's ranking among the 134
districts in the study.

• The district's score, percentage or num-
ber compared to the statewide average.

• The district's score, percentage or num-
ber compared to the national norm.

• The year-to-year trends within the district
(three years of data were available for most
categories).

In order to avoid stories that were a mass of
mind-numbing statistics, each student was
instructed to pick and write about only two or
three or four of the most revealing numbers.
The class interviewed the school superinten-
dent, the county executive and the president of
the teacher's union to get their perspectives.

Journalists with even modest skills in using
spreadsheets could duplicate this project in
any community where the state compiles simi-
lar information in database format. The project
does, of course, involve a lengthy commit-
ment of reporter time. Smaller papers with
fewer resources may want to explore a coop-
erative effort with a college journalism class.

Teacher tips
Here are some thoughts for teachers con-
sidering a class database assignment.

• The project takes a substantial amount of
classroom time—one-third of the periods for
a semester. But the time commitment is justi-
fied by the educational value. In addition to
learning about databases during three com-
puter lab sessions, students had to use their
interviewing skills, work with an instructor and
editor who really demanded stories of publish-
able quality and required students to meet a real
deadline. And, of course, publication of the re-
sults further justified the time investment. Each
student got a good clip.

• The project also requires a substantial com-
mitment of time by the instructor. To make this
work as a class project, the instructor has to divide
the database into a sufficient number of related
categories so that each student is able to develop
a separate story of substance.

To assure stories of publishable quality, the
instructor also has to spend more time than usual
making specific suggestions on how stories might
be rewritten. And then the instructor probably
will spend considerable time preparing stories for
publication.

I spent four or five days polishing stories,
writing headlines, designing tables, preparing
page layouts and working with the editor to put
the section together.

• A cooperative editor is essential. Larry Smith,
the editor-publisher of the weekly LaFollette
Press, was an integral part of this project. Smith,
who is an adjunct instructor at the UTK journal-
ism school, envisioned something even grander
than I dared to suggest initially, and he offered
many suggestions along the way to improve the
final product. Once students had examined the
data and compiled their initial findings, he met
with the class in a news meeting setting to share
his knowledge of the community and school
district and offer suggestions for developing sto-
ries.

• Instructors may want to grade students as
they complete each major step in the project. On
this one, students were graded on the following:
a spreadsheet exercise that resulted in overall
rankings for all school districts; a memo listing
the most significant findings from each students'
assigned data categories; a test on numbers and
statistics; a first-draft news story; a critique of
other students' first drafts; and, finally, a rewrit-
ten news story.

Instructors who would like copies of project
assignments and handouts may obtain them by
sending me an e-mail request. Please include
your postal mailing address.

CAR Trips: First ventures
Keeping CAR local
By Jim Toler
The Free Lance-Star
Jim Toler attended a NICAR On-The-Road
seminar in Washington, D.C., in December.
Tapping a world's worth of information via
the Internet. Adding depth and perspective to
stories by analyzing data. Probing how govern-
ments spend tax dollars and how laws are en-
forced.

Those were the objectives my editor Virginia
Demaree and I set for starting CAR at The Free
Lance-Star in Fredericksburg, Va. The idea was
to get someone in the newsroom comfortable
enough with spreadsheets, databases and Internet
searches so that other reporters would be able to
apply technology to their beats. Considering we
used calculators to figure election results last
fall, this was a worthy goal.

Here are some of the stories that have re-
sulted:

Chasing Data
Police reporters seemed to be writing an
increasing number of high-speed chase stories
last year. The pursuits often ended in injury-
causing crashes and several suspects died. Based
on those observations, I set out looking for data
on police pursuits. Working with cop reporters,
we quickly found out that only some local police
and sheriff's departments had electronic records
and even then the information was insufficient
for comparison.

So I built a database of 65 chases from stories
in our clip files. Using Lotus Approach (an easy
database for first-timers), I constructed 25 infor-
mation fields, and from that I was able to deter-
mine trends. Our findings: Police initiate chases
for minor infractions a majority of the time,
most drivers who flee are under 25 and chases
typically end in crashes.

By examining state police and local figures,
we also found that National Transportation
Safety Board fatal accident statistics under-
counted the number of deaths in Virginia in one
of the years we examined.

Police in the Fredericksburg area haven't
rewritten pursuit policies, but the stories and a
follow up have prompted debate.

Cop and dollars
Localities in our area between Washington,
D.C., and Richmond face similar problems with
crime. Yet there's wide disparity in the amounts
of money spent on law enforcement among the
city of Fredericksburg and neighboring Stafford
and Spotsylvania counties. Using an Excel
spreadsheet, we compared law enforcement
budgets and the number of cops on the street in
each locality. In a story published in April, we
showed that Spotsylvania County spends the
least on law enforcement, though it's one of the
fastest growing counties in Virginia.
Spotsylvania officials are now in the process of
hiring additional deputies.

Concern about crime has been on the rise.
Spotsylvania was the scene of an abduction and
murder of a teen-age girl last year. In May, two
young sisters were abducted and murdered. Like
the earlier case, their bodies were found in an
adjacent county. The cases have drawn national
attention and concern there's a serial killer at
work.

After the May slayings, we used spread-
sheets to analyze violent crime statistics and
homicide rates in the region. The stories pro-
vided context for the unusual cases.

Educational effort
Where does all money for area schools go?
How much gets to the classroom?

Those were the basic issues examined in an
analysis of instructional expenditures over a
seven-year period.

Education reporter Kiran Krishnamurthy and
I put the data into spreadsheets. We found one
county, which had a reputation for its school
system, had fallen behind a neighboring county
in per pupil expenditures. The reason: the sys-
tem known for its schools had to put more into
building schools to cope with growth while the
other had increased classroom spending.

The story challenged long-held perceptions
about which systems were getting dollars into
the classroom.

Overall, our focus is local.
We want to examine issues that make a
difference in the lives of people who live in the
community. We try never to forget that behind

Stats from the road
Using regression analysis
By Sarah Cohen
NICAR
When Carol Napolitano and Paul Goodsell
wanted to study the effectiveness of Omaha
schools, they turned to a tool that reporters
increasingly use: regression analysis.

The method is growing in popularity among
education reporters, as NICAR found in our
first-ever seminar on advanced computer-as-
sisted reporting techniques in Philadelphia last
month, which focused on reporting on educa-
tion statistics.

But the Omaha World-Herald's experience
shows why using multiple regression analysis
— a technique that's become a buzzword in
newsrooms—requires more than some sophis-
ticated software and a desire to show it off.

Napolitano and Goodsell spent weeks in-
side the schools they identified long after their
statistical procedures were completed. What
they saw not only put faces on their results, it
explained them. In underperforming schools,
Napolitano saw chaos. In exceptional schools,
she saw teachers who returned year after year,
discipline that kept disruptions at bay and
strong principals.

Defining Reality
First, a few definitions. What is regression
analysis? It's just a tool that helps you level the
playing field by predicting one number based on
values of other numbers. In Omaha and other
places, that meant predicting test scores based
on demographics of the student population, such
as poverty, English language skills and stability
(called "mobility" in school reports).

Typically, reporters subtract the predicted
scores from the actual scores. What's left over is
what U.S. News & World Report has started
calling "value added" in its annual evaluation of
American colleges and universities. It's the
improvement that's attributed to the school's
effort rather than the advantage or disadvantage
that students bring to the schools from home.

The results can be striking. In Omaha, al-
most half of the schools that performed worse
than the analysis would have predicted on
California Achievement Tests scored better
than the median county-wide. Almost half that
outperformed the prediction scored below the
district median. Hanging out at the schools
confirmed their statistical results. At the most
effective schools, teachers kept order, gained the
respect of the kids and challenged them to work
hard. At the least effective, kids slept at their
desks, flashed gang signs and wandered around
aimlessly with a helpless teacher standing by.

Lessons Learned
Omaha's statistical technique can become a
lesson for many reporters hoping to make sense of
the proliferating school reports. The first battle was
getting good data. What Omaha learned was that
more isn't necessarily better— just more flexible.

After years of fighting, Omaha won access to
a database containing 70,000 individual student
records on the California Achievement Test, the
home ZIP code, the school and a couple of other
identifiers including participation in school lunch
programs. What it meant was that Omaha, unlike
others who have tackled this project, had actual
scores rather than the percentage of kids who
scored in certain ranges. It also meant they could
match the ZIP codes with demographic informa-
tion about the home neighborhood, not the school
neighborhood, in a district with busing.

What they ended up using in their analysis,
though, was familiar: All but one was a traditional
measure of poverty or advantage, ranging from
the percentage of parents in the home ZIP code
with college degrees to the percent of students on
free or reduced lunch. The last was the percentage
of minorities taking the tests. Together, these
factors accounted for up to 84 percent of the
difference in median test scores among Omaha
schools. The other 16 percent was, well, news.

If Omaha wanted to predict school perfor-
mance, why did it exclude information on, say,
dollars spent or PTA hours logged? Its goals,
unlike those of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
featured last month in this space, were to isolate
the characteristics of a school that teachers, prin-
cipals, or officials, couldn't control. That way, it
could evaluate the extra value each school brought
to education rather than predict more exactly the
school's performance on a series of test measures.

The method wasn't without controversy.
School officials told Omaha reporters and editors
that they'd ruin the lives of each 2nd grader in the
district. They condemned the method. A school
official's daughter, who was a graduate student
nearby, e-mailed daily to question another detail
of the method after the series ran. But the analysis

Continued from page eight: Statistics in education
had one strength the school officials couldn't
deny: It confirmed internal, unpublished studies
conducted by the school system itself in its
attempts to identify the best and worst of Omaha's
schools.

And it did so with compelling anecdotes
from inside those schools. Here are some tips for
reporters who want to tackle something like
Omaha's project:

• Fight for information on students rather
than settling for the school reports offered up on
the Web. This information was crucial to
Omaha's ability to look at a range of student
demographics using Census data.

• Identify your goals early on. In Omaha,
reporters wanted to evaluate the performance of
the education system in each school.

In Arkansas, reporters decided that it didn't
matter why schools were good - they wanted to
develop a model of quality that ignored socio-
economic factors.

Both are legitimate goals. Just decide which
is yours.

• Watch for bad data, but don't get paralyzed.

In Omaha, for example, certain schools were
designated "universal free lunch" schools. So
many of the kids qualified that the schools just
gave the program to everyone and stopped count-
ing how many would have gotten the reduced
price lunches elsewhere. They didn't show up
as poor in the database.

• Look at more than one year's worth of
information. Omaha looked at schools that un-
der- or over-performed five years in a row.

• Use the scientific method, and understand
all of your results.
If you need help, hire it. Omaha, in fact, used
two consultants, John Bare and Brenda Sugrue,
to lead them through the maze of numbers and
tests.

• Don't let the school officials intimidate
you. They'll always tell you that you've made
big mistakes, and you're irresponsible.
If you have been responsible, don't let it
dissuade you.

always temporary and the new development
will eventually return to the tax rolls.

Day 4
Another emerging issue in Ohio is urban
sprawl. Urban folks complain about the govern-
ment investing in building new highways, sew-
ers and other infrastructure to allow people to
move out of the city.

Instead, critics argue, the money should be
spent to improve older urban communities.

The local industrial relocations identified in
the first day's story clearly followed the trend of
moving outward into greener pastures — liter-
ally and figuratively in terms of tax cuts.

A small spreadsheet of basic Census data
also demonstrated the corresponding shift in
population and wealth during the past 30 years.

Day 5
For the final day, I tackled the issue of the
slippery numbers. In monitoring the tax abate-
ments — which are given in exchange for prom-
ises of job creation — communities often rely
on annual estimates provided by the companies.
The numbers were suspect.

The company receiving the county's largest
tax cut of $10 million, for example, was getting
credit for creating 143 jobs while openly
downsizing.

And some companies obviously never could
live up to their promises. When the raw payroll
and job numbers — those that were the basis of
granting the abatements — were calculated,
they didn't add up.

Some deals, if fulfilled, would equate to
creating jobs paying an average of more than
$100,000 annually, while others promised full-
time jobs paying $12,000 a year.

Questions raised around the state about tax
abatements recently led to $500,000 being set
aside in the state budget to hire an outside expert
to conduct a statewide review. The review is
under way.

On the Internet
Backgrounding individuals
By Alan Schlein
Schlein News Bureau
Dozens of search engines exist to give you
first clues on backgrounding individuals. This
is not a comprehensive list. Just ones I've
found useful in finding people online. The best
test for most search engines is to put your own
name in and see what turns up. Compuserve
offers Phone File' America Online offers
"White Pages" and CD-ROM's are available
with the nation's phone numbers. Netscape
also offers a "People" icon that provides vari-
ous searches for addresses, phone numbers or
e-mail addresses of people and companies.

• Switchboard: www.switchboard.com
Good tool for finding people and e-mail
addresses.

• Whowhere: www.whowhere.com
Also good as phone book, business re-
source and e-mail address finder.

• Yahoo's People Page: www.yahoo.com/
search.people

• Lyco's People Find: www.lycos.com/
pplfndr.html

• Excite's People Finder: www.excite.com/
reference/people.html
Broad search coverage by concept. See
later reference to Excite for best journalism
usage.

• Alta Vista: www.altavista.digital.com
My favorite (so far) of all the search en-
gines — especially powerful if you know
exactly what you are looking for. If you do put
it in quotes and check it out, use the advanced
search capability to designate word proximity
in a phrase. Also a full-text index of Usenet
newsgroup archives.

• Infospace: www.infospaceinc.com
This one is good for finding people, e-mail
addresses and directions to the location. It's
one of several good mapping programs and
gives directions in simple terms (like go right,
instead of go west).

• Four11: www.four11.com
411 is great for searching e-mail addresses,
white and yellow pages phone books and also
has a reverse directory capability, when you
have a number and want to know who lives
there.

• Internet Address Finder: www.iaf.net
This seems to be the most comprehensive for
finding e-mail addresses, including obsolete and
old ones.

• Saavysearch: www.cs.colostate.edu/~dreiling
/smartform.html
It looks through multiple search programs and
gives you a single list of hits back. I find it saves
time.

Backgrounding Tools
• Dejanews: www.dejanews.com
You can search for a topic, returning all the
archived newsgroup messages that mentioned
that topic, or search for an e-mail address to get all
the messages that someone has posted (great for
finding out subject's interests). BUT BE AWARE:
while you can read others postings on the usenet
or news group, they can also read yours. A recent
New York Times story noted that a well-known
privacy advocate had posted 527 messages to
usenet groups in the past 18 months, with postings
to 32 different newsgroups, everything from a
cyberpunk mailing list, a beer newsgroup and a
Debbie Reynolds fan club.

• Fraternity and Sorrority Connection: www.
greek.com
You can link to this site for some alumni links.

• Finding Faculty: www.petersons.com
They publish the textbook Register of Higher
Education, a great resource for finding adminis-
tration folks at universities. Not on-line yet. They
do, however, have the best on-line service avail-
able to search for a university employee.

Finding Professionals
• Profnet: www.prnewswire.com
Originally run by Dan Forbush at the State
University of New York — Stony Brook, it has
now been merged with PR Newswire, a public
relations wire service. They still take your request
and broadcast it to thousands of university press
flacks nationwide. Include your affiliation, a very
specific description of the type of expert you are
seeking and the type of questions you need an-
swered and information on how to contact you (e-
mail and phone). They usually get an answer.

Tech Tip
The data, they are a changin'
By Richard Mullins
NICAR/Missouri School of Journalism
Sometimes you need to make changes in
your data — cleanup, standardization, etc. A
question often heard in NICAR bootcamps is
something like "I know how to do this in FoxPro,
but I don't know how to do it in Access." Since
the reverse of this question also comes up, I'll
cover the basics of both.

Updating data
Here is the query in Access:

UPDATE Contribs
SET NewOccupation = "Homemaker"
WHERE Occupation = "Housewife"

This is how to do the same thing in FoxPro:
there are two commands typed in the command
window.

USE Contribs
REPLACE ALL ;
NewOccupation WITH "Homemaker" ;
FOR Occupation = "Housewife"

In FoxPro, the table you are working on is
defined first, in a separate command ("use,"
which is the same as going through the File/
Open dialog box.) In Access, the table to work
on is specified after the word UPDATE. The
words are different, but they have in common a
way to define the column to work on, the text to
put in it and which rows to perform the change.

Deleting data
• Access:
Maybe you won't use this as often, and never
on the only copy of original data. Uplink readers
would never commit a blunder like that.

Anyway, in creating a subset of a larger data
set, sometimes you make the first cut by creat-
ing a new table based on rows meeting a certain
criteria.

You could do subsequent delete commands
to further whittle down that table. This SQL
command in Access will delete all rows where
the occupation field contains "ATTORNEY"

DELETE FROM Contribs
WHERE Occupation = "ATTORNEY"

Access tells you how many records will be
deleted before it actually deletes the records.

If you click cancel on the message box,
nothing happens and the records remain. If you
click OK, Access deletes the records and you
can't retrieve them.

• FoxPro
USE Contribs
DELETE FOR Occupation = "ATTORNEY"

Again, FoxPro takes two commands to do
what is specified in one command in SQL and
Access. After this FoxPro command, the records
fitting the specified condition are only marked
for deletion; they still remain in the table. You
can still RECALL the records. This next com-
mand does the deletion and is not reversible.

PACK

FoxPro will not give you a prompt before
this command is carried out. If you say "oops,"
the next thing you say as the smart Uplink
TechTip reader that you are: "I'm glad I have a
backup."

Handout of the month
Quick Hits
By Andy Hall
Wisconsin State Journal
Any of these issues may be worth of an in-
depth project. But if you've got only a day or
a week, you can produce meaningful stories
examining portions of these issues.

Education
The racial achievement gap: Is it widening
in your community's schools? Even if you're
handed a news release and told to write up the
latest test scores, you can quickly dig up addi-
tional data from the schools or your state's
education agency. (Some state agencies are
listing this data on the Internet.)

Method: Compare current high school cu-
mulative GPAs, listed by race, to figures five
years ago and, if available, 10 years ago. Use
the same procedure for standardized test scores
administered at various grade levels. Don't let
the school district simply release the "aver-
age" score for the entire student populations.
Also, examine the scores, listed by race, for
each school. You'll see some interesting dif-
ferences.

Questions: Is the gap between whites and
minorities expanding? Why or why not? Can
the differences be explained by other "risk
factors" such as poverty and high mobility?
National education experts say they know of
no major school district in the nation that has
substantially reduced the racial achievement
gap. If your schools have, you've got a huge
national story. If they haven't, you've still got
a huge story.

Tip: Look for students or schools whose
experiences defy the stereotypes. They'll pro-
vide inspiring stories of success — and poi-
gnant stories of failure.

Population trends
How has the population of your community
changed since the 1990 Census? Don't wait
for the 2000 Census to find out.

Method: Contact your State Data Center
(list of centers available through 301-457-
1305). Also check the Census Bureau's
homepage, www.census.gov, and particularly
the annual county-level estimates for race/
Hispanic origin, sex and age at www.
census.gov/population/www/estimates/co9094.html (See handout from USA Today's
Paul Overberg for details; call IRE at 573-882-
0684.) Be sure you understand the limits of the
data.

Tip: New data became available in July.

Crime
Where is violence concentrated in your com-
munity? Which police officers handle most of the
violence?

Method: Obtain the police department's data-
base for calls for service, or for reported crimes.
Or persuade the department to provide you with
such information as the address having the great-
est number of violence-related calls, the block
with the greatest number of calls, and the officer
responding to the greatest number of violence
calls. Long after you've published your major
package of stories, many quick-hit-stories re-
main hidden in the data.

Tips: There's great value in stories demon-
strating that crime can be traced to specific build-
ings and to a relatively small number of people.
Your stories give the community a place to focus
efforts such as rooting out bad landlords and bad
tenants, or obtaining more police patrols.

Quick-hit angles include: which cops handle
the greatest number of violence-related calls, and
what are their perspectives on trends in the com-
munity? What types of calls do officers in your
community handle? Which date, day of the week
or time are most frequently associated with re-
ported violence? How long does it take the police
to arrive to incidents? What patterns do you find
when you analyze the sex, age and race of vio-
lence victims?

Redlining
Are insurance companies excluding minori-
ties from homeowners coverage?

Method: Examine state insurance department
records. Start by focusing on a particular com-
pany. Determine how much of the market that
company holds across the metropolitan area.
Determine what share of the market the company
holds within each ZIP code. Obtain Census data
listing minority population within each ZIP code.
Is there an interesting pattern? In 1995, Madison-
based American Family Insurance settled a law-
suit over its Milwaukee policy-writing practices

IRE/NICAR Notes
Campaign finance assistance
By Brant Houston and Jo Craven
NICAR
One of the worst tasks in computer-assisted
reporting is data entry. Yet doing data entry is
usually the only way to do one of the best kind
of stories: analysis of state and local campaign
finance reports.

But, in the coming years, there is a chance
that campaign finance stories may not have to
rely on massive and time-consuming data entry
projects.

Electronic filing of campaign finance reports
has become a hot topic among state election
officials and campaign finance reformers.

A recent report (soon to be updated) by the
Center for Governmental Studies in Los Ange-
les reveals that all but four states are considering
ways to encourage or require electronic filing.

And in July, 40 state election officials from
more than a dozen states met to share questions
and ideas about electronic filing and disclosure.

As outlined in the center's report, electronic
filing and disclosure of campaign contributions
and expenses can streamline administrative costs,
permit faster reporting on the information and
aid the public in making better decisions during
elections.

For journalists, electronic filing and disclo-
sure through diskette or through World Wide
Web sites would allow dozens of timely and
meaningful stories during an election, rather
than afterward.

There already is progress in some states.
While the systems are not perfect, here is a list
of some of their efforts:

• Hawaii has implemented electronic filing
of campaign finance reports and is in the process
of upgrading its system. The Hawaii system
visually mimics the state's paper forms. It pro-
vides diagnostics, including spell checking. And
it supplies housekeeping functions, such as gen-
erating letters notifying filers of missed dead-
lines.

• Iowa has developed an electronic filing
system and expects voluntary filing to begin in
August. The first reports expected to be avail-
able are PAC filings in October and candidate
committee filings in January.

• Michigan permits electronic filing, but has
not developed filing software.

• Twenty-two states have pending statutory
legislation for electronic filing. Among those
already considering how to start their own sys-
tems are Michigan, Missouri, Oklahoma, New
Jersey, Illinois and Ohio.

What's missing
Although steps have been made, we are con-
cerned about moves not to disclose street ad-
dresses or to restrict information electronically
that can be obtained on hard copy.

For example, California has voted to omit
contributors' street addresses from data that it
puts on the Web and is debating whether to omit
cities as well—decisions that will make it impos-
sible to clearly identify multiple contributions by
the same individual.

IRE and NICAR are pushing for electronic
filing and have the ear of election officials who
are trying to come up with standardized reports
and coding for electronic filing.

With help of a two-year grant from the Joyce
Foundation, located in Chicago, IRE and NICAR
have begun the Campaign Finance Information
Center.

The center, which is just getting started, plans
to be a repository for federal, state and local
campaign finance data and to help journalists
analyze that data.

We already are reviewing the electronic filing
issues with state officials and campaign finance
groups, representing the interests and needs of
journalists.

In September, we plan to attend a larger
conference of election officials where we will
push hard for meaningful changes.

Medical waste, voting, state aid, affordable
housing, wardens...Got time for more?

• Do any hospitals in your area burn medi-
cal waste to generate electricity? The pollu-
tion may be making patients and employees
sick.

• As politicians spend millions trying to
win votes, check to see how many pols and
other local leaders bother to vote.

• When your state doles out economic de-
velopment aid, where does it got? If any ends
up in funny places, such as a shaky deal to prop up
a factory in the governor's hometown, you've got
a hot issue.

• When a developer or politician brags that
they're creating affordable housing, check it out:
How many people can really afford these places?

• Who are the wardens of the prisons in your
area? These people wield extraordinary power
over the lives of inmates and employees, but
