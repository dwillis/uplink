Uplink
A newsletter for the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting

Uplink update
Many journalists still think of computer-assisted reporting as long-term, tree-eating (at least for newspapers) projects. But this month's Uplink highlights how computer-assisted reporting can be used for beat and deadline reporting.

Ralph Frammolino of the Los Angeles Times shows how quickly a database manager can help a reporter get the scoop and beat the competiton on a story everyone else is covering.

Paul D'Ambrosio writes about the non-stop CAR stories the Asbury Park Press produces, while Bill Dedman of AP and Richard Mullins of NICAR recount the tribulations and triumphs of supplying AP bureaus nationwide with federal campaign finances.

And, for the beat, Gwen Carleton offers a review of some of the year's best CAR crime stories.

Newly acquired skills reveal jury profile
CAR & OJ: Perfect together

By Ralph Frammolino
Los Angeles Times

Talk about instant gratification.

The Los Angeles Times recently invited NICAR to town to put me and nine other reporters, editors and researchers through a week-long computer-assisted journalism boot camp. The goal: To lighten the load on the paper's overworked in-house computer gurus by introducing at least a few newsroom types to the rudiments of transferring files and analyzing statistics on a spreadsheet or database program.

Our mission—besides trying to complete a game of computer Solitaire during class breaks or when the instructor wasn't looking—was to overcome the fear of ASCII, DOS, ANSI anda handful of other tortured acronyms, and to eventually integrate the powerful tool of computer analysis into daily reporting or projects.

But no sooner had I walked back into the newsroom the next Monday morning, then my (gulp) newly acquired "expertise" was put to the test. And on no less a story than the O.J. Simpson murder trial.

The judge and attorneys on the case were close to making the first cut of the jury pool, and my editor was eager to turn a quick profile of those still in the running to determine the fate of the Hall of Fame running back.

All we had to go on were three pages of responses each member of the jury pool gave on questionnaires about their backgrounds, impressions about the case, what they had learned from the media and their own experiences with crime.

Under normal circumstances, we'd either eyeball the responses or tally up a few categories—race, sex, educational background—and paint a broad-brush portrait of the panel. But the NICAR training helped us to dig deeper, be more precise and do more extensive comparison.

We set this up by using the Microsoft Access program. After looking at the three-page forms, I decided to create about 30 fields to capture each juror's age, race, sex, educational level and home city, as well as key responses about media exposure, attitudes and personal habits that could be represented by symbols or a simple yes or no.

Thus, I recorded whether each watched the infamous chase of the white Bronco and for how long; heard anything about Nicole Brown Simpson's previous 911 call to police alleging O.J.'s domestic abuse; had met Simpson in person; and had ever seen him play football.

I recorded what their friends said

The CAR Lot
CAR's Field of Dreams in NJ

By Paul D'Ambrosio
Asbury Park Press

If you put a gun to my dog's head and
forced me to write one of those movie
comparison leads, it would probably read
something like this: CAR at the Press is like
"Field of Dreams"— If you build it, they
will come.

In the last two years we developed a
computer-assisted reporting program that is
accessible to everyone. We have open
access to NEXIS, CompuServe, Internet
and America On-line.

Anyone who wants to get involved with
CAR can learn at their own pace. We have
held several Internet classes, and this
summer, we trained 19 staffers during a
week of intensive CAR classes.

We have installed 486/66 computers in
each of our six bureaus, and at our sister
paper, The Home News. The staff has access
to FoxPro, Excel and Mosaic. SPSS for
Windows and Atlas GIS are currently
limited to one system because of software
costs.

The Press' program is broken into two
areas: projects of a state or national interest,
and those dealing with local issues.

To understand our computer-assisted
reporting program, you have to understand
the Press' news area. We cover 83 towns in
two counties. New Jersey has a strong
home rule charter, which means most of the
information we need is kept only at the
municipal level.

There is no state or county agency that
collects tax information or police records for
us. In order to provide context for any
regional story, we have to negotiate with 83
bureaucrats, all of whom have a different
interpretation of the state's vague and
anemic Open Public Records Act.

The only way to keep track of all that
information is with PCs. In early 1994, we
decided to take a look at delinquent property taxpayers in one county. The municipal reporters collected printed tax lists from
each town and we had clerks build our own
database of deadbeat taxpayer information.

Four months and 50,000 names later, we
ran a two-day, eight-part series. We not
only outline the damage delinquent taxpayers were doing to the tax base, we also
named names: a state judge, two political
kingmakers (including the GOP's former
national finance chairman) and an
assortment of local and county politicos.

Other stories we have done include:
Finding that the dead were still
voting in one county.
Discovering that the governor's
hiring freeze was anything but a freeze.
Exploring the world of sexual
deviancy via the Internet and local
bulletin boards. The resulting article ran
on our Health page.
Showing that the state's crime rate
hasn't changed in the last 10 years,
despite a plethora of mandatory-minimum
prison sentence laws and billions of
dollars in new prison instruction.
Perhaps the greatest hurdle at the Press
is not money or management support, but
what I call the "15-Minute Syndrome."
This is when a reporter, coat in hand, asks
you to show him or her how to do CAR in
15 minutes.

Staffers have learned to use NEXIS for
quick research, but there is a reluctance
by many staffers to get involved with
databases and spreadsheets that may take
more than a day to examine. I have yet to
hit upon a way to get staffers involved
with intense CAR on a regular basis.

As a result, many of the above stories
were written by Rick Linsk and myself, or
in conjunction with other staffers. What I
have seen is a generation gap—new
staffers who have come to the Press in the
last year are using the PCs more frequently than staffers who have been at the
paper longer.

To remedy this situation, I hope that a
series of intensive, week-long training
classes next year will close the gap and
fulfill our "Field of Dreams"—reporters
flocking to personal computers.

Contribution charts cover all 50 states
AP scores with big FEC project

By Brant Houston
NICAR Managing Director

Its creators may call it "public service
agate," but an Associated Press project
recently demonstrated how computer-assisted reporting can strongly bolster
routine election coverage.

With a lot of toil and ingenuity, Bill
Dedman, director of computer-assisted
reporting for AP, and Richard Mullins of the
National Institute for Computer-Assisted
Reporting gave AP bureaus up-to-date
contribution data just before the November
federal elections.

AP bureaus in every state received 25 or
more reports for federal candidates in their
area. The charts used different categories to
sort contributions from individuals and
political action committees.

For example, one chart sorted contributions by city, another by top fundraising days
and yet another by special interests. Altogether, Dedman and Mullins analyzed
contributions to 1,300 federal candidates.
The longest chart alphabetically listed all
individuals who gave $500 or more.

Mullins, an assistant professor at the
Missouri School of Journalism and an
academic adviser for NICAR, did the slicing
and dicing of Federal Election Commission
data for AP. The FEC collects and distributes contribution data for candidates.

In an intensive effort that spanned two
months, Mullins developed reports on a
NICAR Texas Instrument laptop—a 486-50
megahertz machine with a 200 megabyte
hard-drive. He used the FoxPro database
manager to sort more than 60 megabytes of
data that contained 300,000 individual
contributions and 128,000 PAC donations.

That was the easy part.

The more difficult challenge was making
the reports suitable for conversion to standard AP agate. Mullins used the FoxPro
memo field to store the appropriate headers,
footnotes, and queries.

He also had to ensure that no report was
longer than 130 lines. If it was, he had to split
it into multiple "takes" because long files
could not be used by the smaller AP members. After a report was ready, Dedman used
a modem to call Mullins' computer and
download the report from Missouri to New
York City.

(Call Mullins at 314-882-2127 or send e-mail to him at jourram@
muccmail.missouri.edu for more technical
details.)

"We made available to AP staff about
12,000 tables," Dedman said. "This allowed
AP reporters to dive in, wade in or stick their
toes in."

Dedman said almost every state AP
bureau used the data for stories.

For the project, AP also purchased special
interest codes from the Center for Responsive
Politics. Those codes identify PACs by
economic or political interest because the
PAC names generally offer little clue as to the
industry or idealogy they represent.

Jacqueline Duobinis, a researcher at the
National Library of Money & Politics, also
assisted on the project with advice and tips.
(The library is affiliated with the center.)

The effort, as Dedman and Mullins said,
was a mass-produced assembly line approach
that resulted in the most extensive campaign
finance information and detail ever provided
for AP bureaus for an election.

"It wasn't fancy, just universal," Dedman
said.

Before election week was over, AP
followed up the initial project with a quick
analysis of the dollars spent by candidates for
each vote. That analysis revealed that the
most expensive winning and losing campaigns for the U.S. House and Senate.

"Oliver North spent the most money to
lose a Senate seat," Dedman said. "He spent
$17 a vote."

Mullins said he hopes the effort might give
helpful ideas to newspapers and broadcasters
trying to distribute state-wide databases to
reporters in their remote bureaus.

For example, some news organizations are
considering writing often-used data onto CDROMs and giving those CDs to bureaus or
reporters who take road trips frequently.

Dedman also said that the real value of
this project will not be the work on election
eve, but during the next Congress when it
will be possible to compare a Congressman's
actions with the contributions.

We made available
to AP staff about
12,000 tables.
This allowed AP
reporters to dive in,
wade in or stick their
toes in.

CAR & OJ

continued: about Simpson (guilty, not guilty,
no opinion); what each potential juror thought
about Simpson; whether each had experienced
domestic abuse, resorted to domestic abuse or
thought it should be treated differently than
other assaults. I noted how each felt about discrimination against African Americans in Southern California (not serious, somewhat serious,
very serious, etc.); whether each had been a
victim of crime and the worst type of crime; who
owned knives; who enjoyed detective novels or
television shows; and who dated people of a
different race.

With a data researcher reading them off, it
took me hours to type in the responses but we
were able to have all 92 files in the Access
database by about 4:15 p.m. I kept two files—
those who made the cut and those who didn't—
and kept adjusting them almost instantly as the
judge and attorneys made their decisions.

For the next 45 minutes, it was just a series of
frantic Access drills—group by, count, descending order, difference divided by the first number—for each category of interest. By deadline,
we could say that 61 percent of the jurors who
had not been eliminated were black, 25 percent
were white; 19 percent said they experienced
domestic violence at home, and many more saw
Simpson at his worst during the Bronco chase
than ever saw him in his glory playing football.

The effort on that first day enhanced our
story and provided fodder for the graphic. Yet
the biggest payoff came on Tuesday, when I used
the database to perform a different analysis.

Rather than concentrate on the jurors who
made the cut, I decided to compare those who
were still in the running with those who were
weeded out. At first, I intended to look at characteristics such as race and geography of the two
different pools when—thanks to Access—something unexpected jumped right out at us.

Each panelist was asked to express an opinion
about the reliability of DNA testing (somewhat
reliable, very reliable, etc.), and the numbers
showed that 39 percent of those who had been
excused were likely to believe in it compared to
10 percent who remained in the pool.

Since the prosecution's case rests overwhelmingly on DNA tests linking Simpson's blood to
the crime scene, this seemed to be a significant
difference and it became the lead of my front page
story the next day. A jury consultant I interviewed underscored the significance further for
our readers by saying that the effect was a "plus
for the defense because there aren't people who
have already made up their minds that it [DNA
testing] is irrefutable evidence...."

The story also noted other important differences that seemed to favor the defense in the jury
pool. More than 80 percent of the rejected jurors
had been crime victims and 31 percent had experienced domestic violence themselves—percentages much greater than those left in the jury pool.

The second-day story was well received and it
couldn't have been possible without the NICAR
training. While it required far less knowledge
and skills than the ambitious computer-assisted
investigative projects featured in recent Uplink
newsletters, it nonetheless shows how far a little
computer work can go.

Tech Tips
Fun with the dir command

By Richard Mullins
University of Missouri

There really is something useful that a
DOS command can do for you, even if you use
Windows all the time because you hate typing
DOS commands.

Computer hard drives can quickly become
like attics or neglected closets. They fill up
with so much stuff that we forget what's there
and waste a lot of space with stuff we don't
need any more or files that are duplicated
unknown times in subdirectories all over the
place.

What if we could inventory all the files on
a hard drive into one sorted text file that could
be viewed with a text editor or printed?

The DIR command, plus a few options,
will do it.

Many DOS users are familiar with the use
of /p or /w after a DIR command. These
switches, as they're called, pause the output of
the DIR list every screenful or arrange the
output horizontally. The following disk inventory command will use three options you
may not have used before.

Here's the command. Change to the root
directory first (cd/), then type:
dir/on/s/a-d > disklist.txt

It may take a minute to finish, and you
won't see anything on your screen while it's
working, but that's it.

Here's the explanation:
The first option — /on — orders the directory output by name. Use /oe if you want to
order files by extension, /od by date, /os by size.

The second option — /s — gets the directory
output for all subdirectories. That's why you
have to do the command from the root directory
of the drive.

The third option — /a-d — means show only
files, not directory names, which you normally
see in a DIR output. We exclude them here
because they would be redundant. Every
subdirectory in the output will have a full path
heading.

To understand this one, remember that DOS
considers directories as a special kind of file.
Translated more exactly, this option means:
include files that don't have the directory attribute. "Slash A" (/a) introduces the attribute
option; "Minus d" (-d) means "not directory."

The greater-than sign (>) is the redirect sign.
If you leave this part off, you'll see the directory
output rush by on the screen without stopping.
Redirecting the output from the screen to a file
(here called disklist.txt) gives you something a
little more permanent you can view or print.

One more tip: If you want a quick reminder
on any DOS command, don't fumble for your
manual; the answer is already on your computer if you have DOS 5.0 or higher. You can
find the short documentation on any DOS
command by typing the command word, followed by /?
For example: copy/?

Crime tops CAR agenda for '94

By Gwen Carleton
NICAR

Judging from the clips we've seen,
computer-assisted journalists made a strong
showing in 1994. Stories made possible by
computer analysis appeared nationwide,
tackling a multitude of topics. Not surprisingly in the year of the Brady Bill, the Crime
Bill and "Three Strikes, You're Out," crime
was an especially popular topic.

As we reported in September's Uplink, the
Wisconsin State Journal continued its award-winning "City of Hope" series into 1994. The
series, which focuses on urban problems in
Madison, looked at several aspects of crime
this year: where the most crimes occur, how
shortages in affordable housing aggravate the
problems and the connection between
unemployment and crime.

Staff reporters did their analyses with the
help of one personal computer running some
inexpensive local police records through
Excel, FoxPro and SPSS software. Yet, they
have become such authorities on crime
statistics that the police now refer some
inquiries to the State Journal.

Meanwhile in Southern California,
Rebecca Fairley Raney took a close look at
youth violence in her three-day San Bernardino Sun series, "Too violent, too young." The
series described how a system designed to
reform truants is straining to keep juvenile
murderers off the street.

Raney analyzed thousands of San Bernardino arrest records. She found that, although
the number of teens arrested remained level
between 1982 and 1992, the severity of their
crimes changed dramatically. Car theft,
robbery and assault with a deadly weapon
made the top ten list of juvenile crimes,
displacing relatively minor offenses such as
truancy and curfew violation. The numbers
portray an increasing number of youths
unfettered by discipline and desperate for
respect, and a legal system that only can deal
with the worst among them.

USA Today reporters Laura Frank and
Sam Vincent Meddis looked at federal
prosecutors across the nation in their special
report, "Unequal justice." They found that,
although the number of U.S. attorneys nearly
doubled during the last decade, convictions
fell. The reporters compared different cities
according to the number of prosecutors, the
number of cases prosecuted and convictions
per million. They discovered wide disparities.

According to the USA Today analysis,
different crime rates drain resources at
different rates, and an avalanche of federal
laws promote selective enforcement. As a
result, neighboring districts can differ
dramatically with regard to who they prosecute and how harshly they punish. The
article also cites legislative efforts to increase
oversight, at least one of them provoked by
the newspaper's investigation.

Another analysis, this one by Jon Schmid
and Joseph Neff of the Raleigh News &
Observer, examined the probable impact of the
celebrated "Three Strikes, You're Out"
proposal in North Carolina.

The story, which appeared as the state
legislature weighed a "Three Strikes" bill,
found the law would do little for the state.
Only one criminal in 2,000 current would
have been affected, according to Schmid and
Neff's analysis of FBI data (Figure 1) and
North Carolina Corrections Department
data.

Of the 177,505 people entering state
prisons between 1972 and 1992, only 91
committed three violent crimes — and more
than half of those criminals remain in prison.
Schmid and Neff showed that only a tiny
proportion of crimes might have been
prevented by a "Three Strikes" law. Just five
criminals are currently in jail for committing
four violent crimes.

The reporters used charts and graphs to
illustrate the age of most violent offenders, as
well as the crimes third-time offenders
committed. They also talked to politicians,
criminologists and convicted felons concerning the crime bill's likely impact on the state.

Elsewhere, other papers went beyond
police, FBI and prison statistics to look at
more unconventional types of crime. Paul
D'Ambrosio of the Asbury Park Press compared the Social Security Administration's
Master Death List (Figure 2) with voter
records to see just how many of New Jersey's
dead are showing on voting lists.

Staff reporters did
their analyses with
the help of one
personal computer
running some
inexpensive local
police records
through Excel,
FoxPro and SPSS
software. Yet, they
have become such
authorities on crime
statistics that the
police now refer
some inquiries to
the State Journal.

6
==End of OCR for page 6==
==Start of OCR for page 7==
D'Ambrosio found 370 dead people registered to vote in the area he examined; one
even changed party posthumously.

An examination of local death records
showed some of those listed as deceased by
the election board actually are alive and well.
D'Ambrosio found other instances where the
election board probably passed a dead
person's registration on to another voter with
a similar name. However, scores of other
posthumous votes remained a mystery.

D'Ambrosio pointed out the Motor Voter
law, which will go into effect Jan.1, will
make it more difficult to remove questionable
voters from the rolls.

Reporters from the (Greensburg, Pa.)
Tribune-Review examined crime in another
specialty area — the rent-to-own industry.
Reporters Sharon Santus and David Josar
discovered rent-to-own stores in their area
typically charge customers more than 200
percent interest for items such as TVs,
furniture and refrigerators. Moreover, the
stores use bullying repossession tactics when
customers fall behind on their inflated bills.

A computerized mapping system at the
University of Pennsylvania's library revealed
nearly two-thirds of the stores were located in
areas with large minority populations and
large percentages living below the federal
poverty level. The computer analysis showed
what consumer advocates had been trying to
prove: that rent-to-own store operators target
minority and poor sections of the community.
The Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office
intends to use the research to help negotiate a
settlement with several rent-to-own operators
in the state.

These stories are just a sample of the
quality work we've seen throughout 1994.
Thanks to all of you for your submissions —
be sure to stay in touch in the new year.

Crime Data available at NICAR

NICAR now has 1994 FBI records, available either for the whole nation or individual
states. The database is divided into five tables: Return A, listing numbers of crimes committed in a number of categories; Supplement to Return A, listing more details about the crimes
(especially types and dollar amounts of property crimes); Supplemental Homicide Report,
listing the victims and offenders in homicides (this also includes victim/offender data on other
crimes); Police, listing assaults and homicides of police officers; and Arson, listing reported
and proven instances of arson.

NICAR also has Federal Death records from the Social Security Administration and data
from the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. SSA Death Records comprise
almost 50 million deaths dating from 1937. The SSA collected the records from Social Security rolls, states, funeral homes and other sources. Data included are SSN, name, dates of
birth and death, state code and zip code.

The ATF database contains the business and mailing addresses of firearms dealers across
the United States. Please contact NICAR for more information and prices.

Front-ends broaden computer use
Sharing CAR with the masses

By Alan Levin
The Hartford Courant

As computer-assisted programs in news-
rooms mature, there's an
inevitable problem: How to distribute the
wealth of computer resources to the masses of
reporters who have little or no high-tech training.

At The Hartford Courant, where I began work
earlier this year, we were bursting with information, but could not always easily pass it on to
those who needed it.

As one of the first papers to aggressively use
computers in news gathering, the Courant had
filled several large hard drives and nine-track
tape racks with data of all descriptions.

Literally hundreds of databases had been
stored away as a resource during Brant
Houston's tenure at the paper (which ended
January 1994 when he became managing director at NICAR).

The data files were available for inspection
on the old computer-assisted war horse, XDB,
an SQL database program. But those files were
inaccessible to many reporters and editors without a computer-trained guide. Though more
than 30 reporters and editors had received
training, the training did not stick unless they
continued to work on computer-assisted stories.

The solution we chose was to create a customized application program in FoxPro for
Windows that took advantage of the searching
power of SQL, but allowed any reporter who
could use a mouse and a pull-down menu the
opportunity to search through dozens of files.

Without going into details of FoxPro programming language, a user enters the system by
clicking on a special icon in the Windows Program Manager.

Once it starts, the program allows users to
choose a database from a Windows-style, pull-down menu. After the database is selected, a
simple search screen appears prompting a reporter to type in a name or some other search
criteria. Clicking the mouse on a box starts the
search. All the SQL language is embedded in
the program and activated without any work by
the searcher.

The menus also give access to a simple help
file designed to guide a reporter through a
search and include text files describing each of
the databases.

The system is by no means perfect. Any real
programmer who examined my crude code
would probably drop dead of fright. Though
most people who use it seem to navigate the
system without problems, it could be further
simplified.

We are also working to expand the types of
data on the system with an eye toward adding to
its functionality.

Our next hurdle is to figure out a way to give
reporters located in our extensive bureau system access to such a program without lugging
hundreds of floppies out to each bureau (not to
mention the cost of buying all those copies of
FoxPro).

But what we found was that almost anyone
with a spare computer and a little knowledge of
FoxPro programming language (or a willingness to beg and cajole the wonderful technical
support staff at Microsoft) can put together a
similar system.

Our customized
application program
in FoxPro for
Windows grants
access to selected
criminal records,
professional listings
of lawyers and
accountants, a
simple state payroll,
an ever-growing list
of contributors to
several
gubernatorial
candidates, some
basic census
information, a listing
of all persons'
registered to own
handguns in the
state and a Hartford
voters' list — among
other files.
