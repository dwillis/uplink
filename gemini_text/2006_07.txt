LATIN AMERICAN CAR
A
bumpy
ride
By Alejandra Fernández Morera
Missouri School of Journalism
Cars travel on highways, but in Latin
America, CAR travels on unpaved
roads. While computer-assisted
reporting has gained popularity in
Mexico and Brazil, it is still terra
incognita in Central America, and
few can point out more than one
journalist who excels in the genre's
many techniques in South American
countries such as Chile, Venezuela
and Peru.
"Few practice and master [CAR],"
said Pedro Armendares, executive
director of the Mexican Investigative
Reporting Center, or CPI, a partner
organization of Investigative Re-
porters and Editors, Inc., based at
the Missouri School of Journalism.
"There are countries where it isn't
practiced at all."
In the countries where CAR is prac-
ticed, the success has been clear.
In one case, a Mexican reporter
discovered that taxpayers' money
was used to pay for $400 towels
for the president's residence. The
reporter used data from a govern-

Program for disabled

By Tom Detzel, The Oregonian
Our stories on nonprofits that employ
severely disabled workers sparked an
FBI investigation and calls for reform
of a little-known federal contracting
program that spent $2.25 billion last
year, much of it on military goods and
services.
For these stories, simple databases
produced profound results.

AIR SAFETY
Poor conditions plague
medical helicopters
By Alan Levin, USA Today
There's no substitute for precision on
a big project.
USA Today set out more than a year
ago to learn more about why air am-
bulance flights were crashing at an
alarming rate. A quick review of the
clips revealed several fatal crashes
that had killed patients. The numbers
of crashes were climbing.
Our guts told us we had a good story.
But you can't attribute major findings
to gut instinct.
That started several months of search-
ing for hard data that eventually led
us to create our own database of
crashes from scratch. Along the way,
we occasionally cursed the sometimes
archaic ways of aviation regulation
and recordkeeping, which can make
data retrieval very awkward. But, in
the end, we had a roadmap laying
out the worst crashes and the major
safety shortfalls. Our data was more
complete than anything the govern-
ment had compiled.

National Conference
More than 800 journalists, edu-
cators and students attended
the 30th Annual IRE Conference,
June 15-18 in Fort Worth, Texas.
The conference offered more than
130 panels and workshops on
covering beats, writing, editing,
producing and hands-on classes
in data analysis.
About 300 people showed up for
Thursday's optional CAR day,
which included panels on issues
as far-ranging as introducing
newsroom intranets and diagnos-
ing medical and care data.
The conference also featured
two rooms exclusively geared
towards CAR: a hands-on room
teaching the basics of Microsoft
Excel spreadsheets and Access
database manager, and a demo
room where journalists showed
off some of the newest and most
advanced technology with pre-
sentations on CrimeStat, satel-
lite imagery, Web scraping, social
network analysis and more.

FIRST VENTURE
Mapping finds holes
in siren coverage
By Gerry Lagnosa, WTHR-Indianapolis
Taking my first crack at ArcView 9.1 re-
minded me of the first time my dad let
me use a chainsaw a little bit scary
(probably more for him than me) – but
a hell of a lot of fun.
I had tinkered around with ESRI's geo-
graphic information system (GIS) pro-
gram for a couple of small maps after
attending IRE and NICAR's Mapping
Boot Camp last summer, but in March
we decided to get serious with map-
ping by taking a look at tornado sirens
in central Indiana.
It's certainly ground that has been
tread before, but not in any in-depth
way in our viewing area. With torna-
do season approaching, we figured it
would be a high-interest story for our
audience that would also give us a
good initiation with ArcMap.
From start to finish, the project took
just about every bit of three months
for reporter Bob Segall, photojournal-
ist Bill Ditton and me. First we made
calls to get siren locations in Marion
and the eight surrounding counties in
the Indianapolis metropolitan area.
Most of the counties either lacked GIS
files on the sirens or had files that
didn't fit our needs. For example, we
already had obtained the data from
Marion County's GIS office, but it was
quite outdated. So we decided to be-
gin from the beginning, building our
own database of sirens from which to
create maps.
Data gathering
Getting the lists of locations was an
adventure in itself. Some counties
were extremely well-organized; oth-
ers not so much. In Hancock County,
just east of Indianapolis, it took sev-
eral phone calls and interviews just to
get to the person who reportedly knew
where all the sirens were. When we
found her at the sheriff's department,
she jotted out a list of locations from
memory. And, when we went to verify
the locations, we found some of them
didn't exist. The problems in Hancock,
characteristic of the smaller counties
in our area, would end up being cen-
Uplink
tral to one story in our series.
With the locations in hand, I built a da-
tabase in Microsoft Access and then
pulled the data into ArcView for geoc-
oding to create a point map of the si-
rens. I was able to match only about
half of the 350 sirens. The rest we
plotted the hard way.
Bill, Bob and I fanned out with hand-
held GPS units and gathered coordi-
nates (in UTM, or Universal Transverse
Mercator, projection) at each of the re-
maining siren locations. This proved

SPOTLIGHT: ON THE JOB
Making sense
of OSHA data
By Mike Casey, The Kansas City Star
How much is a worker's life worth?
What are the most deadly workplaces
in your town? Are there factories in
your town that are exposing workers to
toxic chemicals?
The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration database has the an-
swers. OSHA is the federal agency
responsible for worker safety, and its
database details millions of inspections
of factories, steel mills and construction
sites since 1972.
Don't let the size of the database or its
complexity intimidate you. For a recent
project about worker safety around
Kansas City, The Star purchased the
data from the IRE and NICAR Database
Library. See www.ire.org/datalibrary/
databases for details about this data-
base and ordering instructions.
To tailor the analysis for our circulation
area, I extracted data for a dozen area
counties. It's easy to do using codes
assigned to each county in each state.
I used Microsoft Access database man-
ager for my analysis of nearly 30,000
records.
The big picture
One way to approach the database is
to think of it as a news story. The main
table is like the lead of a story that gives
you a little about the most important as-
pects of each inspection. The accom-
panying tables are like the rest of story;
they provide more detail and context.
The main table has more than 50 fields
that give the name of the company, its
address, the reason for the inspection,
the number of OSHA violations, penal-
ties the company paid and a number of
other items.
Other tables describe the inspection in
more detail. If the inspection concerns
a fatality, the database tells you the
name of the accident victims as well as
the accident's causes.
Another table explains the violations
in more detail and references the spe-
cific regulations that the company vio-
lated. Yet another table provides details
about hazardous chemicals found in
the workplace.
What connects all of these tables is
the unique inspection number, which
OSHA calls the activity number. It's
just a matter of using your database
manager to connect the tables using
that field.
Job deaths
I was interested in looking at fatalities.
In OSHA's codes, a fatality is classified
as an "A" in the inspection-type field. I
selected all "A" inspection types from
the main table and joined that to the
others using the inspection number.
Here are some of the things I learned:
• Low fines for workplace deaths or in-
juries are common even when OSHA
cites employers for a serious viola-
tion. In 80 such fatal and injury ac-
cidents, half of the fines Kansas City
area employers paid were $3,000 or
less.
• A table detailing the citations showed
that the agency sometimes down-
graded its most serious willful viola-
tions to unclassified and then sub-
stantially cut its penalties in these fa-
tal accidents. To find the change, look
in the section that details the types of
violations. "W" stands for willful and
"U" stands for unclassified.
• The table that details fatalities gave
the names of workers and I noticed
that more workers, with Hispanic
names were dying on the job. After

4
July • August 2006

==Start of OCR for page 5==
checking death records, I learned
that indeed more Hispanics par-
ticularly immigrants - were killed at
local worksites.
The data also showed that falls and
electrocutions often caused workplace
fatalities in the Kansas City area.
Data dirt
Like all databases, OSHA's has strengths
and weaknesses. I've found the data-
base information nearly always matched
the information in the written reports. Of
course you would want to get written re-
ports to verify information about specific
incidents in your story.
However, some of the OSHA fields
contain dirty data. For example, Ford
Motor Co. can be called Ford Motor,
Ford or Ford Motor Co no period.
That creates a challenge in finding the
companies with the highest number of
violations.
Here's how to work with that problem:
start by selecting and grouping the
company names. That will give you an
initial idea of the variations. Once you
get the top five or 10, check their ad-
dresses to see if the name of the facility
is connected to the same address. A
company could have several locations,
and you want to account for that.
Using the address, city and ZIP code
fields can help you come up totals for
each worksite. For example, Factory A
has the most violations and its address
is 100 Main St. Using wild cards, you
also can expand the search of names
and addresses to get all of the records
at the address or variations the com-
pany name. Do the same thing with the
company's name using ZIP codes and
city codes as a way to check. Yes, this
is time-consuming work, but it helps to
make your reporting more accurate.
For construction inspections, the work-
site is listed as the location, so a con-
struction company may have a number
of different sites listed. That makes
coming up with a top violator among
construction companies very difficult, if

Keith Rogers of the Las Vegas Review-
Journal used Department of Labor sta-
tistics to review compensation appli-
cations made by sick employees who
once worked at six radioactive and toxic
materials sites. Rogers found that the
Nevada Test Site had a compensation
approval rate of 6 percent, the lowest of
the sites. Yet only at the Nevada site did
employees work in areas that had been
detonated by nuclear devices. Nearly
900 cases were denied because former
employees couldn't prove beyond a 49
percent likelihood that radioactive mate-
rials contributed to their illnesses.
Randy Ludlow of The Columbus Dispatch
reports on respiratory illnesses contract-
ed by more than a quarter of the em-
ployees working in a TRW brake plant
in Mt. Vernon, Ohio. He also reviews the
lack of Occupational Safety and Health
Administration standards to regulate
practices that caused these respiratory
problems. As he describes in the July-
August issue of The IRE Journal, Ludlow
found illness trends by using a database
Uplink
of TRW employee complaints from the
Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation.
He incorporated that data with OSHA's
inspection data and anecdotes gathered
from dozens of interviews.
In Time magazine, Donald L. Bartlett
and James B. Steele review how em-
ployees lost their retirement benefits
when 401(k) plans tanked and pension
plans were pulled out from under them.
Company-sponsored pension plans
are under-funded by $450 billion in the
private sector and are quick to vanish
when companies hit financial troubles.
While 2004 reports claimed the average
401(k) is worth $61,000, the authors
say that the median value was only
$18,000.

Resources for workplace reporting
IRE and NICAR offer resources for jour-
nalists who are interested in using com-
puter-assisted reporting to cover work-
place issues.
The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration inspections database,
available from the IRE and NICAR da-
tabase library, contains more than 3
million records of OSHA inspections in
all states and U.S. territories from 1972
to February 2006. The OSHA database
contains a variety of information on
workplace conditions and accidents, in-
cluding hazardous substance accidents.
Journalists can use the database to
identify companies that have dangerous
working conditions for employees and
to examine the safety record of compa-
nies involved in breaking news.
The Database Library also offers the
Wage and Hour Enforcement data-
base kept by the U.S. Department of
Labor. It shows violations and penal-
ties related to labor laws, including the
Fair Labor Standards Act, Family and
Medical Leave Act, and the Migrant and
Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection
Act. It contains records regarding more
than 700,000 cases that have been
closed between the 1980s and 2004.
Journalists can investigate the fairness
of compensation paid by employers,
Identify industries with frequent offend-
ers, and check adherence to child labor
laws.
In addition, IRE resources can provide
guidance in using the databases to for
stories. Chapter 12 of The Investigative
Reporter's Handbook has a section
specifically about safety and health in
workplace.
In the March-April 2002 issue of Uplink,
Ron Nixon explains pitfalls of OSHA
data and offers some measures to
overcome them. In the same issue.
Stephanie Armour lists workplace data
resources, along with some specific
story ideas.
Tipsheets contributed by journalists are
also good resources to refer to in cover-
ing workplace issues.
Barbara Clements and Daniel Wickert
of The (Tacoma, Wash.) News Tribune
offer advice about analyzing OSHA
data and suggestions for making the
data more manageable. They also pro-
vide a list on web resources regarding
an OSHA project. (Tipsheet No. 2458)
Justin Pritchard of The Associated
Press explains where to get information
about death in the workplace and how
to handle that information. (Tipsheet No.
2062)
Journalists have written a number of
stories about the workplace and avail-
able from the IRE Resource Center:
David Barstow of The New York Times
revealed that OSHA declined to seek
prosecution in 93 percent of the cases in
which it determined an employer's "will-
ful safety violations" caused a death.
The report also finds that "OSHA's re-
luctance to seek prosecution persisted"
even when the violations caused mul-
tiple deaths, or when the victims were
teenagers. (Story No. 20850)
An investigation by The (Fredericksburg,
Va.) Free Lance-Star disclosed that state
government agencies are among the
most common violators of worker safety
standards, but they never get fined. The
story identifies the area's top violators
in the past 25 years, including the City
of Fredericksburg and the County of
Stafford. (Story No. 18656)

CAR TOOL
Wrestling useful data
from PDFS
By Neil Reisner, Florida International University
Let's start with the obvious: PDFs are
devils masquerading in angelic garb.
They emerged in the early '90s as a
purportedly benevolent effort by de-
veloper Adobe Systems Inc. to create
"a universal way to communicate doc-
uments across a wide variety of ma-
chine configurations, operating sys-
tems, and communication networks."
Translation: Let's create software that,
with a mouse click, can change any file
- including data tables - into an image
that cannot be imported into a spread-
sheet or database manager. In other
words, let's make documents that look
like data but cannot be sliced, diced or
analyzed.
That's not what Adobe said, and it's
probably not what the company in-
tended. But PDFs have been driving
geeks crazy ever since. Fortunately,
there are a number of free or inexpen-
sive programs that extract data from
PDFs and turn it into text that imports
easily into CAR software.
PDFs the acronym also stands for
"Portable Document Format" - weren't
born evil.
The format, in fact, resolved an impor-
tant dilemma because they can be cre-
ated from the output of any software
and can be viewed on any computer.
A PDF rendition of an Excel spread-
sheet created on a PC can display on
a Mac, Linux or Palm device even if
Excel isn't installed. All that's required
is the free PDF viewer distributed by
Adobe for all common platforms and
some not so common anyone work-
ing on an OS/2, IBM AIX or HP-UX
box?
Moreover, because PDFs are hard to
edit not impossible as conventional
wisdom holds - there was at least a
reasonable assurance that a PDF ver-
sion of a document was the same as the
original document. PDF quickly became
the format of choice for attorneys look-
ing to exchange documents for review
and for document managers seeking to
save storage space by scanning paper
documents and saving them as easily
retrievable PDF images.
Creating PDFs used to require purchase
of the $300 Adobe Acrobat program.
Today all it takes is any of the widely
available PDF print drivers distributed
for free. Which means, of course, it's
even easier for records custodians to
make our lives harder.
So, how do we deal with them?
As always, the key is to know the public
records law for your state. The question
is whether the law views PDFs as re-
sponsive to a request for data.
Here in Florida, for example, the law
reads, "An agency must provide a copy
of the record in the medium requested if
the agency maintains the record in that
medium..."
Journalists interpret this to mean that, if
the data is in Excel, then we can get it in
Excel. But some officials (and their law-
yers) apparently think "medium" to refer
to CDs, DVDs or floppy disks and thus
believe that a PDF copy complies with
the law. Others claim that their comput-
ers can produce nothing but PDFs, ob-
viously incorrect based on the technol-
ogy itself.
No one in Florida has mounted a chal-
lenge to these positions, and the prac-
tice seems to be spreading. The law
may be clearer, though, in other states.
If a PDF is all you can get, it's time to
turn to one of several free or low-cost
programs that will tum PDF documents
into text; some even use optical char-
acter recognition to convert scanned
PDFs paper documents that have
been scanned and turned into PDF im-
ages. Note, however, that none of these

XPDF/PDFTOTEXT (Free)
For the last few years, PDFTOTEXT has
been the way to go. Part of the open
source XPDF PDF tools suite, it's avail-
able at no cost at www.foolabs.com/xpdf.
XPDF is a simple program with no fancy
Windows interface. It's command-line
driven - for you young'uns, that means
typing commands from the C:/prompt.
(Note: IRE and NICAR use PDFTOTEXT
in CAR training exercises. A NICAR tu-
torial with a conversion example can be
downloaded at www.ire.org/training.)
XPDF does a good job of pulling text
from PDFs, but a few other new pro-
grams make the job a little easier and
add some bells and whistles that XPDF
lacks. None are free, but they won't
break the bank, either. Evaluation cop-
ies of each program can be downloaded
from their Web sites.
Foxit Software (www.foxitsoftware.com)
specializes in PDF utilities and offers
a number of products useful in CAR.
The company's free PDF Reader is an
Acrobat substitute that does not require
installation, opens immediately and is
less than 1Mb in size.
Foxit PDF Text Viewer ($39)
(Figure 1)
Among the simplest PDF utilities, PDF
Text Viewer offers a simple Windows in-
terface and the ability to toggle between
PDF and text views. It's a self-contained
executable that requires no installation.
Text can be saved with a simple "File/
Save As" command or it can be cut and
pasted from the display. Output is in a
fixed-width format easily handled by
Excel's import wizard.
Foxit PDF to Text Converter ($59)
(Figure 2)
PDF to Text is a hyped-up version of
PDF Text Viewer that lacks the PDF
Text toggle function of the viewer, but it
makes up for that flaw in other ways. Its
Windows Explorer-like interface displays
a list of folders, PDFs in each folder and
the properties of a selected document.

successfully.
The program features a slick, intui-

exactly what data to convert. It takes
its best guess on the data layout but
also allows adjustments. It does not,
however, have the preview function of-
fered by PDF2XL; you see the result
only after the conversion is complete.
The program's OCR function leaves a
lot to be desired both in terms of ac-
curacy and because it lacks PDF2XL's
data verification/editing functionality.
There are other programs that will
convert PDFs into importable text.
But based on conversations on the
NICAR-L listserv, some adroit search-
ing and some quick tests in other
words, the kind of we-need-a-pro-
gram-to-do-something-now research
journalists often conduct the pro-

able and promising.
Until now, the venerable XPDF has
been the only silver bullet that could
tame devil PDFs, and it merits our
respect. These programs add more
bullets to our gun belts and maybe a
wooden stake and some wolf's bane
potion as well.

Sirens
continued from page 3
to be more painful than geocoding. In
fact, it was the most time-consuming
aspect of the project. We logged hun-
dreds of miles searching for sirens, and
the locations we were given weren't al-
ways as accurate as we'd hoped.
Once we had the data, I made the first
of many novice mistakes on this proj-
ect by hand-keying the data captured
in the GPS units into the database.
(Learning how to upload the data from
the GPS is something on my to-do
list.) In any event, after the database
was complete, it was a snap to add the
data to the map, as X,Y points. After
adding geographic features such as
townships, populated places, and cen-
sus tract data, I created buffers around
each siren. We had our maps the
first comprehensive picture of tornado
siren coverage in central Indiana.
I should note that we didn't get to this
point without some epic battles with
ArcMap. I struggled with everything
from projections to buffers. At one
point, the program simply crashed re-
peatedly, sometimes without warning
and other times with cryptic error mes-
sages - "The instruction at 0x77fcc043
referenced memory at 0x00000038.
The memory could not be written. Click
on OK to terminate." After scouring
technical papers, talking to technical
support and re-installing the software,
the problem persisted on a couple of
county files. I could eliminate the prob-
lem by re-creating the files, but I still
don't know what caused the error.
Our initial stories looked at the overall
picture of tornado sirens in the area,
from how well they work to how much
area they cover. Using census block
data, we were able to report roughly
how many people live in dead zones
where there are no tornado sirens.
On the WTHR Web site, we posted
our own maps of the siren coverage
for each county and hired a consultant
who created an interactive Google
Maps application that allowed users
to look up sirens near their homes.
(See the "Cause for Alarm" stories and
maps online at www.wthr.com/global/
Category.asp?c=79536. In the March-
April 2006 Uplink, Sarah Okeson of the
Journal Star in Peoria, III., describes
using GIS to report on siren coverage
for print journalism. Former NICAR
data analyst Brian Hamman won a
Student Society for News Design
award for his news graphic on tornado
sirens in the Columbia Missourian.)
Lessons
I learned a few lessons and would do
things differently if starting over.
Initially, we had decided to use a gen-
erous 1.5-mile siren coverage radius,
even though only the best sirens under
ideal conditions operate at that range.
The reason: most counties were un-
able to give us specific decibel-level
data on individual sirens so we wanted
to err on the side of caution. In retro-
spect, I wished I had handled those
buffers differently, creating multiple
rings rather than one radius.
In fact, for a second take on our sto-
ries, we did that, showing graduated
half-mile distances from the sirens
and explaining the variance in siren
range in a legend. For this second
go-around, we were able to report
how many schools and parks are out-
side the practical range of the sirens.
Getting the schools and parks on the
map was much simpler than the sirens
because we were able to download
shapefiles from Indiana's GIS clear-
inghouse Web site, http://igs.indiana.
edu/arcims/statewide/index.html.
Another thing I'd change relates to the
display. Early in the project, I decided
to add each county's siren data as a
separate layer because I wanted to
have an area map and county maps. I
had 16 layers of geocoded and GPS-
recorded points. When I added buf-
fers to each of the layers, some over-
lapped and caused unwanted color
variations. If I had to do it again, I
would create one master data table
that includes a county field.
While ArcMap is exhilarating to use in
terms of its analytical power, I also dis-
covered that it's just plain fun to create
these visuals that can add so much to
our storytelling. I found myself think-
ing much more like a graphic artist
than I ever thought I would, though I
readily admit that my initial maps look
pretty rudimentary. But, humble as
they were, the maps helped us get our
point across in ways that we couldn't
do before, and they helped us find out
what the point of story actually was.
(And I didn't even saw off my foot.)

SCHOOL DATA
Finding diamonds
in the rough
By MaryJo Sylwester, St. Paul (Minn.) Pioneer Press
The results from Minnesota's standard-
ized test-used to measure progress for
No Child Left Behind - yields a predict-
able list when sorted best to worst. At the
top are schools from the wealthy neigh-
borhoods and suburbs. At the bottom are
schools from poor neighborhoods.
This didn't seem like a fair way to assess
how schools are performing; yet that is
often how test results are portrayed. We
decided to dig a little deeper.
In June, the Pioneer Press published a
series of stories called "Schools that
Work," stemming from a statistical
analysis of test scores that revealed
which elementary schools were doing
better than expected, considering the
socioeconomic and other demographic
factors of their students.
We found 13 schools serving predomi-
nantly low-income students that had
consistently done better than expected.
Then we visited those schools and came
up with five things these schools were
doing that experts said were the keys to
success. The five things were: focusing
on reading above all else; using small-
group instruction whenever possible;
having an effective and cohesive staff;
maintaining a structured, disciplined
environment; and providing services be-
yond the classroom such as homework
help, dentists and donated clothing.
The bulk of the work was traditional street
reporting, but we wouldn't have known
where to start without the data analysis
to point us in the right direction.
Test score data is readily available in
Minnesota from the state department
of education, in delimited-text format.
Since all states are required to collect
test score information as part of No Child
Left Behind, chances are good that your
state will have data as well. What might
differ from state to state is the acces-
sibility and the level of detail provided.
Some states allow you to download the
data directly from a Web site; others
require a public records request. Some
provide student-level data, others (like
Minnesota) offer only school-level data.
You might also have trouble getting the
scale (or raw) score. Some states only
provide the percentage of students
meeting proficiency standards.
Numerous academic studies have
shown that a child's family income is the
most significant predictor of how he or
she will perform on a standardized test.
Typically, 50 to 60 percent of the differ-
ence in scores between one student and
another can be explained by income.
As a result, it's no surprise that schools
serving predominantly low-income
populations will have much lower aver-
age scores. The statistical procedure we
used-regression-estimates the impact
of income on a school's test scores, then
uses that measure to "predict" what each
school's average should be.
There are several types of regression,
and of course, it can be used to measure
many other things besides test scores.
The type we used is called multiple
regression because we had more than
one independent variable.
Our dependent variable was the test
score (the scale score). The indepen-
dent variables were the percentages of
students on free or reduced-price lunch
(a proxy for income), percentage with
limited English proficiency and percent-
age in special education. As expected,
the income variable proved the most
significant. English proficiency played a
small role, while special education was
not significant at all.
Our test results were averages for each
school in math and reading for third and
fifth graders. And we had three years'
worth of data. So we had up to 12 scores
for each school (if they had both third
and fifth graders). We only used scores
where at least 30 students were tested,
and schools that didn't meet this mark
across all three years were excluded.
Then we used SPSS statistical software
to run separate regressions on each set
of scores (3rd grade math for 2004-05
would be one set, for example).
I won't get into the specifics about how
to run a regression here (you can learn
more by reading tipsheets in the IRE
Resource Center or attending the IRE
and NICAR Advanced CAR Statistics
Workshop), but you should know that
one of your options in SPSS is to instruct
the program to add fields to your data
table showing the predicted score and
something called a residual.
The residual shows the difference be-
tween the predicted score and the actual
score. You can have the residual ex-
pressed either standardized (the number
of standard deviations) or unstandard-
ized (the raw difference between the two
numbers). The general practice is that
any residuals of one standard deviation
or higher can be considered above the
predicted results. A negative residual of
one standard deviation or more is con-
sidered below the prediction.
We decided to go one step further and
make sure any schools we were labeling
as "above predicted" earned it for being
consistently better than expected, across
multiple grades, subjects and years. So
we averaged the residuals and used
those to determine whether a school
would be labeled as above, within or
below predicted scores.
The statistical analysis took several
weeks, partly because we worked on
this in between other assignments and
partly because the analysis required a
lot of trial and error, and double-checking
our work with two professors. One was
an education professor in Minneapolis
who not only taught quantitative analysis

14

classes but also did her own analyses
for publication. The other was a statistics
professor from Georgetown University
whom I had worked with previously. He
is especially good at explaining things
in layman's terms. Having two people
review my work and help me interpret
the results proved comforting.
At this point in the analysis, the big ques-
tion was, "What do we do now?" We
had a list of a couple hundred schools
identified as above predicted. Many were
the ones you'd expect: the rich suburb or
the elite magnet school. But there were
some surprises in there, too.
After talking with some school testing
experts, we decided to focus on schools
with 60 percent or more low-income stu-
dents. One expert told us that if a school
with high-income students did a merely
adequate or mediocre job teaching, the
students likely would still have above-av-
erage performance. But if a school with
low-income students had just mediocre
teaching, those kids would likely fail.
We also decided to focus only on the
overachieving schools and essen-
tially create a roadmap for what schools
should be doing, rather than harping
on things the other schools were doing
wrong. Many of the schools we visited
were shocked to learn we were writing
about them in a positive light, but none
were surprised to hear they were per-
forming above the expectations.
We tapped several other data sources
such as student and teacher demo-
graphics, teacher experience, and
student mobility rates. We generated
crosstabs in Access for the schools that
fell into each group. For example, this al-
lowed us to see that the above-predicted
schools had lower mobility rates and
higher averages for teacher experience
than schools in the other two groups.
Instead of publishing the predicted
scores and residuals, the stories simply
identified schools as above, within or
below predicted. One reason is that we
thought the numbers might add more
Uplink
confusion than it was worth, and that
they implied a greater level of precision
than our analysis truly had. Experts told
us student-level data would yield much
more rigorous findings, but Minnesota
does not make that data public.
Several people have asked me how I
convinced my editors to let me get a
regression analysis into the paper. The
simple answer is that I didn't. I convinced
them to put a good story in the paper.
The analysis helped us get there. You'll
notice that the stories (except the meth-
odology) are almost devoid of evidence
of our analysis. We picked out some key
points and relegated most of the analysis
results to the file cabinet.
All of the test score and other education
data were posted in a searchable data-
base online. The stories and database
can be found under "Special Projects" at
www.TwinCities.com.

Disabled
continued from page 1
charities that mainly employ workers
who are blind or severely disabled. But
our reporting found that nonprofits were
increasingly using workers with mild or
questionable disabilities.
The biggest contractor, the National
Center for the Employment of the Dis-
abled in El Paso, Texas, repeatedly
failed to document that it was using
enough disabled labor. And it had
paid the management firm run by its
president a stunning $8.7 million over
two years.
Although much of our information came
from sources inside the charities them-
selves, reporters Jeff Kosseff, Bryan
Denson and Les Zaitz used the federal
Freedom of Information Act and Internal
Revenue Service charity disclosure
forms (Form 990) to get a grasp of
overall trends in the program and target
specific charities for investigation.
Kosseff used FOIA to obtain five years
of annual reports from the 627 chari-
ties. The reports, kept by a tiny federal
agency (Committee for Purchase from
People Who are Blind or Severely
Disabled) that oversees the program,
contained data on annual sales, wages
paid to the disabled, and the hours
worked on federal contracts.
When he received the data in a Micro-
soft Excel spreadsheet, it was immedi-
ately clear that the bulk of the contracts
went to the 50 largest charities. We
decided to focus our reporting on this
group, which the data showed had tre-
mendous revenue growth since 9/11.
War bucks
Denson wanted to know the impact of
the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He
looked up the Dun & Bradstreet D-U-
N-S nine-digit identification numbers
of each of the 50 contractors, punched
them into a spreadsheet and sent them
to the Defense Department, asking for
a list of their military contracts.
The Pentagon can find contracting
records quickly if you provide a con-
tractor's D-U-N-S. You can find these

other sites.
The Pentagon turned the request
around in two days. We then had a
list of every defense contract for each
charity over five years, detailing con-
tract amounts and the type of goods
or services provided. The bulk of the
growth had indeed come from a burst
in military spending.
Defense business was only part of
the picture. What about other sources
of income - contracts from local gov-
ernments and private firms - for the
charities? And how could we measure
whether workers or charities managers
were benefiting?
To get aggregate numbers, Denson
turned to the charities' tax forms.
Gail Hulden, the newsroom's head
researcher, used Guidestar Premium
(www.guidestar.org/services/guidestar_
premium.jsp) to acquire 990s from the
top 50 charities for 2000 and 2003. We
built a data entry form in Microsoft Ac-
cess, and Denson and two copy aides
began the painstaking process of build-
ing and proofing a database.
The information they punched into the
database included the 9-digit employee
identification number (EIN); the tax
return year; the name of the nonprofit;
the total amount of government contri-
butions; total revenue; total expenses;
net assets; officer compensation; total
salaries and wages; other wages; re-
lated income; and four-year income.
This data allowed us to measure growth
in all categories.
Money trail
In a access form, they focused on pay-
ments to charity officials, entering total
compensation for up to five officers, five
employees and five contractors paid
$50,000 or more. In all, they entered
and verified the names, compensation
totals and deferred compensation to-
tals for 1,165 officers, employees and
subcontractors.
Denson also flagged any insider or
related-party transactions noted on
the forms for follow-up reporting. In
the case of the National Center for the
Employment of the Disabled, they were
numerous enough to lead us to add a
reporter to the project and look hard at
the charity's president.
We later added 2004 data when it be-
came available. It allowed us to report
that average compensation for top
executives at the 50 biggest charities
grew three times faster than hourly
wages for their disabled workers. At
least a dozen execs pulled in $350,000
a year or more in pay and benefits,
while many workers were paid less than
minimum wage.
The management firm run by Bob Jones,
who ran the El Paso nonprofit, had re-
ceived $14 million in charity payments
over five years and loaned millions more
to other businesses in which Jones
had an interest. Records we requested
under FOIA, plus documents from in-
ternal charity sources, showed that the
charity had repeatedly been unable to
document its workers' disabilities. Many
were counted as disabled because they
spoke little or no English.
Jones resigned the day our story about
him appeared under the headline:
"Texas charity a launchpad for entre-
preneur's empire." He is now under
investigation by the FBI, the IRS and
the Texas attorney general's office.
Our first-day story about weak over-
sight of the contracting program,
"Charity leaders prosper as 'disabled'
is redefined," prompted calls on Capitol
Hill for an overhaul of the Javits-Wag-
ner-O'Day program. It also sparked an
intense and ongoing debate within the
community of nonprofits that serve the
disabled.

continued from page 1
Since the Vietnam War, air ambulances
have gradually become commonplace.
Every major metro area has a steady
stream of helicopters landing on the
roofs of major trauma centers, bringing
the most severely injured and gravely
ill patients to the best facilities.
In recent years, air ambulances have
helped rural areas cope with major
changes in the health care system. As
more and more small rural hospitals
shut down, helicopters have become
increasingly important. For millions of
Americans, the only quick way to an
emergency room is by air.
During the 1980s, the number of air
ambulance flights surged. But in the
race to provide more service, safety
standards suffered. In the years 1985
through 1988, there were 15 fatal air
ambulance helicopter crashes, com-
pared to only seven in the previous
four-year period.
The National Transportation Safety
Board attributed the spike in crashes
and deaths to carelessness that had
crept into overstressed operations and
to inadequate federal oversight. The
crashes fell rapidly under the glare
of attention from investigators and
federal aviation regulators.
As we began our reporting last No-
vember, we suspected that many of
the same dynamics had crept into the
industry over the past few years, but
the NTSB was just beginning its own
review of the crashes and had not is-
sued any findings. So we started our
own data collection.
As a general rule, the NTSB keeps one
of the cleanest databases in govern-
ment. (As a former database editor at
the Hartford Courant, I've seen dozens
of them. As many of you know, they're
often poorly constructed and dotted
with typos.) Because the agency has
no regulatory power and relies solely
on the bully pulpit, it is also unusually
generous with its public records.
But when it comes to niches such as
the air ambulance world, the database
can be difficult to work with.
In order to be included in the NTSB's
database, an accident must meet a
test that requires factors such as fatali-
ties, serious injuries or significant dam-
age to the aircraft. All air ambulance
accidents that met the NTSB's statu-
tory requirements were in its database,
but there is nothing in the data to flag
these flights. They are simply listed
under a broad category of charter

Description
On July 14, 2004, at approximately 1220 mountain
daylight time, a Bell 222U helicopter, N277LF,
was substantially damaged while maneuvering during
departure from Lower Lake, Idaho. The helicopter
was registered to PNC Leasing LLC of
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and operated by CJ
Systems Aviation Group, Inc. of West Mifflin,
Pennsylvania. The commercial pilot, flight nurse,
paramedic, and patient who was being transported
were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions
prevailed for the 14 CFR Part 135 medical
evacuation flight, and a flight plan was not filed.
The flight was originating at the time of the
accident.

flights. (Though it hasn't been formally
announced, we understand the NTSB
is planning to modify its data to make
it easier to identify crashes involving
medical flights.)
We did our best to collect lists of the
accidents from a variety of sources.
NTSB provided us with a spreadsheet
of accidents after 1995 and we combed
reports and other sources.
Paul Overberg, a USA Today database
editor, helped design the database
and created a data entry form in Mi-
crosoft Access. We set our able intern,
Marie Skelton, loose on the NTSB's
database. The web version of the da-
tabase (www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/query.asp)
includes a fairly robust search function
that allows broad text searches. She
began plugging in words like "nurse,"
"ambulance," and "hospital" to look for
any cases we might have missed.
To be as thorough as possible, we
also entered into our database the
accidents involving medical flights on
planes, not just helicopters.
Working one or two days a week,
Marie finished in about two months. I
don't recall the exact number, but by
using this crude-but-effective manual
search, she found a handful of acci-
dents that others had missed. At our
conclusion, we had 279 accidents from
1978 to the early months of 2005.
It turned out that finding the crashes
was the relatively easy part of the
job. Next, I had to audit Marie's work
(which was extremely clean) and to
categorize all of the accidents.
The NTSB provides detailed informa-
tion about the cause of each accident.
But that information comes in the form
of a fairly lengthy string of text, and
over the years, the agency has used
different formats.
Here's a typical cause finding: "The
failure of the pilot to maintain rotor rpm
and his inadequate recovery from a
bounced landing. Factors contributing
to the accident included the tailwind
EMS Helicopter Accidents
All EMS Helicopter Crashes
Fatal EMS Helicopter Crashes
3 per. Mov. Avg. (All EMS Helicopter Crashes)
3 per. Mov. Avg. (Fatal EMS Helicopter Crashes)
condition and the tree."
We needed to boil this down to key
components, namely the pilot's error,
in order to know what patterns were
behind the crashes. How important
were errors by pilots versus mechani-
cal failures? Were crashes occurring
in bad weather? At night?
In this particular case, I concluded that
an error by the pilot contributed to the
crash, but I did not include this case
among those caused by weather. Our
definition of a weather-related crash
required more than a normal breeze.
The only way to identify whether these
broad types of issues were leading
to crashes was to read over every
single NTSB cause finding. I then
added a bunch of additional fields to
our database for every conceivable
type of accident, from pilot error and
mechanical failure to factors such as
the time of day.
I went through each record twice to
ensure consistency and accuracy.
Later on, I met with a statistician at
the Federal Aviation Administration to
compare our database with one they
had compiled to make certain we had
not missed any accidents or included
cases that didn't belong.
I also went through the data and
made sure we had accurate counts
of the dead. In particular, we needed
to know how many patients had died
on flights.
It wasn't pretty, but I hand-entered
crash totals and various pieces of
information into a Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet. That allowed us to help
visualize some of the trends. For ex-
ample, it became obvious very quickly
that poor visibility from bad weather
and flying at night was frequently a
contributing factor to crashes.

not impossible. Still, if the data shows
a company with a high number of vio-
lations you can probably say the com-
pany was among the top violators.
Another area to look at is the industries
with the most violations. You can do
that by using the Standard Industrial
Classification codes in the inspections
table.
These SIC codes pertain to all types
of businesses. For example, it breaks
down construction by carpentry, elec-
trical work, masonry work and other
fields. Picking the industries with the
most violations and then looking for
companies in those industries with a
number of violations will give your story
an immediate focus.
The OSHA database goes back to the
days of Richard Nixon's presidency
so a number of the companies on the
database are no longer in business or
have changed names. I focused on a
10-year span from 1994 to 2004 to get
around that problem.
I've done many stories on workers'
safety and I've always gotten a warm
response from victims' families. These
people are eager to tell their stories,
which help make for a dramatic project.

We were far from the first news orga-
nization to notice that air ambulance
flights were crashing at alarming rates.
But the painstaking collection of data
(and my editors' patience while I com-
pleted the work) allowed us to write
about the problem with authority.
Even though the NTSB had not yet
issued its own findings about the
growing number of air ambulance ac-
cidents, we were able to reach strong
findings on our own. Here are two of
our main conclusions:
• "Industry safeguards are so lax that
pilots have repeatedly caused ac-
cidents by knowingly flying into bad
weather, failing to check weather
conditions or otherwise violating
federal or company regulations. In
at least 17 cases since 1995, pilots
crashed after flouting fundamental
flight rules."
• "About two-thirds of fatal air ambu-
lance crashes occur in poor visibility,
the newspaper's analysis shows.
Even so, pilots are not required to
have special training about what to
do when they encounter fog, snow
or darkness."
(To see the story online, go to www.
usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-07-
17-air-ambulance-crashes_x.htm).
The information on these crashes
was available for anyone to see, but
no one had bothered to compile it in
one place. The data also helped us
identify the most egregious crashes.
The narratives of these accidents
were horrific and helped make the
story readable.
The one thing we wished we could
have done was to determine the rate
at which air ambulance flights were
crashing. The raw number of crashes
was the highest in history, but the in-
dustry had grown considerably in the
past decade. Unfortunately, neither
government nor industry collected the
number of flights or hours of flight.
Of course, the data was only one of
the elements we relied on to report
the story. Sources helped us identify
patterns of problems and pointed us to
documents that highlighted the short-
falls of regulators. We spent just as
much time using traditional reporting
techniques as we did doing computer
analysis.
But without our computer analysis,
the story would not have been half
as good.

ment Web site that the president himself
was unaware of. In another prominent
story, CAR tools helped to determine
that millions of dollars in pension funds
intended for the poor were actually given
to people with property and stable gov-
ernment jobs in Costa Rica. CAR helped
find that 27 representatives from Rio de
Janeiro in Brazil's Chamber of Deputies
(the country's lower legislative chamber)
had doubled their wealth in five years in
suspicious ways.
Spreading CAR skills south of the U.S.
border has been a struggle for the past
10 years. Two of the latest initiatives by
Latin American journalists had their epi-
center in Paraguay and Costa Rica.
In April, a group of Paraguayan journal-
ists launched a new organization, the
Paraguayan Journalists Forum, FOPEP,
supported by the Knight Center for Jour-
nalism in the Americas. Its inauguration
was marked by a visit from José Roberto
de Toledo, a leading Brazilian CAR prac-
titioner, who conducted a workshop.
One day later, on April 28, Lise Olsen of
the Houston Chronicle and Costa Rican
investigative reporter Giannina Segnini
teamed up to train 25 journalists in a
CAR workshop at the University of Costa
Rica's School of Communication Sci-
ences in San José. The Knight Center
and the new Costa Rican Institute for
Press and Freedom of Speech, IPLEX,
supported this seminar.
A survey of 89 Latin American CAR-
trained journalists, conducted earlier
this year as an academic project at the
Missouri School of Journalism, sheds
light on the export of CAR skills from
U.S. journalists to their continental
neighbors.
In Latin America, Microsoft Excel is the
predominant software used for data
analysis. Database managers, such as
Microsoft Access or FoxPro, have yet to
make headway, and mapping and statis-
tical applications are virtually unknown.
The majority of CAR-trained journalists
agreed or strongly agreed that CAR is
feasible in their countries. But only a
minority said that CAR is understood in
their newsrooms, the survey found.
Learning to drive
CAR arrived in Mexico in 1996 as an IRE
initiative to develop CPI, a similar training
organization with Olsen its first director.

CPI introduced the skills of finding,
breaking down and analyzing electronic
information to Spanish and Portuguese-
speaking newsrooms with varying de-
grees of success. After being a pioneer
in Latin America, CPI is no longer the
lone active CAR trainer. New projects
have emerged in the region while CPI
explores new ways to revitalize its mis-
sion after having exhausted the U.S.
funding, a $544,000 McCormick Tribune
Foundation grant.
In 2002, professor Rosental Alves found-
ed the Knight Center for Journalism in
the Americas a professional training
and outreach program for journalists
in Latin America and the Caribbean
at the University of Texas at Austin.
The introduction of online CAR train-
ing can be rightfully attributed to the
Knight Center, a project currently funded
through June 2008. The distance-
learning project started in 2003 and is
located at http://knightcenter.utexas.edu
/distancelearning.php. Since then, two
online CAR workshops have been
taught in Portuguese, reaching 26 jour-
nalists from more than 12 Brazilian cities
at a time. The online technology also
provided seven sessions of Mathemat-
ics for Journalists, benefiting more than
100 reporters.
From a different trench, a former CPI
trainer also helps to keep the legacy
alive. Alma Delia Fuentes, an instructor

stand that CAR is also for the daily story,
that you do not have to save it for 'special
occasions,' that to master CAR the best
route is to start with small projects."
According to the Missouri School of
Journalism survey, in Mexico, 22 percent
of CAR-trained journalists reported us-
ing the skills every day and 34.1 percent
said they use them once a week. In Bra-
zil, 42.9 percent reported working daily
on their own CAR-related projects.
Latin CAR leaders
Some can claim excellence in practic-
ing CAR. Their names surface time and
again as field leaders; Colombian Gerar-
do Reyes, Venezuelan Carlos Subero;
Brazilians de Toledo, Marcelo Soares,
Fernando Rodrigues, and Angelina
Nunes; Argentineans Daniel Santoro
and Sandra Crucianelli, Costa Rican
Segnini and Mexicans Armendares and
Fuentes.
They have written stories that have
embarrassed presidents, reformed bu-
reaucracies, revealed political patronage
and exposed drug traffic details.
Brazil seems to be a harbor for many
leaders. José Roberto de Toledo, 40,
was among the first Brazilian journalists
to be trained by CPI in 1996. His first
CAR story was a detailed account of
the flight of human capital from Brazil to
the U.S. lured by attractive professional
offers.
"Lise [Olsen] showed us an American
immigration database,” said de Toledo,
whose story ran on the front page of
Folha de São Paulo, the largest circulation
newspaper in Latin America.
Like de Toledo, 30 percent of Brazilian
and 61 percent of Mexican CAR-trained
journalists have had a CAR story pub-
lished on page one, according to the
Missouri survey.
Brant Houston, IRE's executive director,
highlights common ground for the vital-
ity in Brazil and Mexico: CPI's impact in
the region during the 1990s and U.S.
funding.
CAR also got a big push in Mexico
in June 2002, when the first federal
open-records legislation was approved.
Sixty percent of Mexican CAR-trained
journalists surveyed reckoned the new
law eased their access to digital public
information.
Because of the law, "Mexico's unique
case might not be representative of
the state of CAR in the whole region,"
Armendares said.
In spite of adverse legal climates
compared to Mexico, CAR has grown
the strongest in Brazil, and even their
Mexican colleagues consider Brazil's
CAR development over the last decade
a success story.
A combination of initiatives is respon-
sible for this achievement. Folha de São
Paulo has for 20 years sponsored a
training program for both its staff and for
journalists fresh out of school. By the end
of 2002, a group of journalists founded
the Brazilian Association of Investigative
Reporting, a not-for-profit organization
with economical and technical support
from the Knight Center, meant to train
journalists throughout Brazil.
Bumpy road
However unthinkable it might be to
disassociate U.S. journalism and com-
puters, many Latin American journalists
from rural areas have limited access to
technology and the education needed
to use it.
"Frequently journalists did not study
journalism, might not have finished high
school and have two or three jobs to
make ends meet," Mexican CAR trainer
Fuentes said.
The lack of familiarity with arithmetic is
also an obstacle. Gradually, CAR-trained
journalists have made peace with math-
ematics. Only 20 percent of Spanish and
18 percent of Portuguese-speaking jour-
nalists said they did not enjoy it, accord-
ing to the Missouri survey. Seventy-one
percent of Brazilians and 60 percent of
Mexicans reported feeling comfortable
computing ratios and percentages.
There are also absurd situations. O Esta-
do de São Paulo, a São Paulo newspaper,
asked de Toledo to give a CAR workshop
in their newsroom, but they had removed
Excel from their computers.
"They asked me 'How do you practice
CAR without Excel or a computer?' Well,
