DATA ACCESS
GIS data
carries
high cost
By Jaimi Dowdell,
IRE and NICAR

For three years, David
Washburn of The San Diego
Union-Tribune has been itch-
ing to get his hands on a file
from SanGIS, an organization
that handles San Diego
County's GIS data. Although the
GIS data is available to the pub-
lic, neither Washburn nor his
newspaper is ready to fork over
$15,000 for one year of data.

"I think my county is ripping me
off and the taxpayers off how
they are handling GIS,"
Washburn said.

Within the past five years, use
of GIS software and data has
exploded in newsrooms. Many
journalists using computer-as-
sisted reporting have found the
programs essential and use
them in their daily reporting.
While many government agen-
cies have posted GIS data files
on their Web sites for free
download, other agencies
haven't been as open.

SPOTLIGHT: CRIME & JUSTICE
Mapping finds bars,
DUI wrecks linked
By Rose Ciotta and Karl Stark, The Philadelphia Inquirer

Drunken driving was old news. It had
been written about and rallied against
for years. Yet, this year, for the first
time in nearly a decade, drunken driv-
ing became a more deadly crime than
murder. After years of decline,
drunken driving's death toll was inch-
ing up nationally and in New Jersey,
and holding steady in Pennsylvania.

Those facts gave us ample reason to
investigate drunken driving in the Phila-
delphia region. But, we faced the chal-
lenge of finding a fresh approach. Map-
ping and density analysis gave us the
tools to dig deeper and come up with
new information for our series, "Loaded
for Trouble," which ran in June.

From researchers we learned of cut-
ting-edge work that found a link be-
tween the concentrations of liquor li-
censes and the locations of alcohol-
related accidents.

We set out to test the connection in the
Philadelphia region. Our first problem
was getting the data. In Pennsylvania,
accident locations are a secret. Attor-
neys for the state cite a law that pro-
tects the state from liability claims. In
addition, Pennsylvania's Department
of Transportation several years ago
removed from its public data on acci-
dents just about every field of inter-

SPOTLIGHT:
This issue showcases some of the
best uses of CAR to dig into crime
and justice. Reporters discovered
that the failure of some Texas judges
to grant speedy trials led to the
release of thousands of suspects,
that there was racial inequity in
Pittsburgh juries, and the correlation
between drunken driving accidents
and liquor license locations.

Data boosts
crime stories
By Megan Christensen,
IRE and NICAR

For the resourceful journalist using
computer-assisted reporting, there are
as many great criminal justice stories
waiting to be written as there are Law
& Order reruns on cable.

Stories about local and national crime
trends often begin with the FBI's Uni-
form Crime Reports. The data is com-
piled from voluntary reports submitted
by city, county, state and national law
enforcement agencies. Roughly 95
percent of all police agencies report

Vehicle accidents
(updated)
How many people died in acci-
dents on U.S. roadways last
year? What are some of the
more dangerous highways?
Questions like these can be
answered with the Fatal Acci-
dent Reporting System (FARS)
database from the U.S. Depart-
ment of Transportation.
Records are available from
1975, when the DOT started
tracking fatal accidents, through
2001. The database has three
main tables to track by person,
vehicle or accident. With this
database, it's possible to find
out many details, such as how
fast a vehicle was traveling,
weather and road conditions,
and whether the driver had prior
convictions for DUI or speeding.

Another database deals specifi-
cally with truck crashes,
whether or not anyone died.
The DOT Truck Accidents da-
tabase has commercial carrier
accidents as reported to state
and local police from 1988
through 2001. The main table
has details on the crash, such
as number of injuries and ve-
hicles involved, plus the name
and location of the carrier. The
database also has the truck's
DOT census number, which
makes it possible to link the
crash database to truck inspec-
tion or truck census databases,
also available from the Data-
base library.

NICAR UPDATE
Another member of
the family moves on
By David Herzog, NICAR and Missouri School of Journalism

As some of you know, Aron Pilhofer,
who directed IRE's Campaign Finance
Information Center, has taken a job as
database editor with the Center for
Public Integrity in Washington, D.C.

For more than a year, Aron had been
busy with IRE and NICAR projects. He
revamped the CFIC Web site and
launched its two online databases
where IRE members can search for
federal political campaign contributions
and simply click on the contributor's
name to see whether the contributor
received federal contracts.

Aron revived Tracker, the center's
quarterly publication that covers cam-
paign finance reporting, and trained
journalists across the country in how
to analyze campaign-finance data for
news reporting.

Aron served as NICAR's in-house open
source software guru, promoting the vir-
tues of free software tools with all kinds
of strange names - Python, Mandrake,
MySQL, TUTOS. When Aron spoke at
the annual CAR conference in Philadel-
phia this year about "World-Class CAR
on 99 Cents a Day," he wasn't kidding.

Starting with the next issue of Uplink,
Aron will contribute a regular feature
focusing on open source software that
journalists can use for their work. For
starters, he'll write about his experi-
ence with OpenOffice, the open source
alternative to Microsoft Office that's
been garnering some interest on the
NICAR-L listserv.

Best wishes in your return to the news-
room, Aron.--

Upcoming CAR, census training

IRE and NICAR has numerous
training opportunities in the coming
months for journalists who want to
learn computer-assisted reporting
and data analysis for reporting on
Census 2000. For a complete list
of training events visit www.ire.org/
training/otr.html.

Here are a few of the many training
highlights:

The Jan. 5-10 computer-assisted
reporting boot camp in Columbia,
Mo., provides hands-on training in
how to use spreadsheets and
database managers to analyze data
for high impact stories.

The Jan. 11-12 Census reporting
workshop in Columbia, Mo., will
offer a track for beginners and
another for journalists with
intermediate census reporting skills.
Paul Overberg of USA Today and
Steve Doig of Arizona State
University will lead the classes.
Hands-on sessions are included.

A Feb. 21 census workshop at
Arizona State University in Tempe
is intended to help beginners learn
how to find stories in the data that's
already been released from Census
2000. It offers a good introduction
for beat reporters, graphic artists or
assignment editors who need a
focused, concrete introduction to
demographic data and computer-
assisted reporting.

CENSUS 2000
Covering income,
commuting with SF3
By Jeff Porter, IRE and NICAR

The flood of Census data is over. For now.

U.S. Census Bureau servers, like jour-
nalists across the U.S., worked over-
time for two months as the Summary
File 3 became available, state by state,
in August and September.

IRE's Census-L listserv buzzed with
questions and stories. Journalists com-
municated by code, it seemed. Sample
question on the Census-L: "Are there
numbers for median household income
by race for 1990? I'm looking in STF3
and not seeing such a table. Anyone?"
Answer: "Table P82."

Incredibly, most Census-L subscrib-
ers understood that answer. It refers
to a specific table released after the
1990 Census.

The SF3 data came through as a se-
ries of tables, derived from the Cen-
sus Bureau's April 2000 long-form sur-
vey, sent to about one of six house-
holds. With that, the agency took the
responses and crafted summaries, re-
leased in 76 data files for each state,
plus a file containing geographic infor-
mation.

And while the data can - and will -
keep reporters busy for months to
come, there are stories aplenty to ex-
amine and learn from.

The gender gap
The Detroit News, for example, looked
at the slow improvement in the "gen-
der gap" - the difference between what
men make and what women make in
the same jobs.

Brad Heath conducted data analysis for
the newspaper. A big challenge, he
said, was not to go too far.

"The biggest problem was that the data
stopped just shy of giving me the smok-
ing gun I was looking for," he said. "The
data the Census Bureau provided show
inequality to be sure, but they can't get
you far enough to show actual bias."

Still, The Detroit News could report that
while every state has made progress
in closing the gender gap from 1989 to
1999, Michigan lagged. In that state,
women who worked full time made 67
cents for every dollar earned by men,
a figure that budged less than 5 cents
in the 1990s. Nationwide, women who
worked full time in 1999 earned 73
cents for each dollar men earned.

Like almost any database, though,
the Census data didn't answer the
question: Why?

"The census made clear that women and
men work at different jobs and have dif-
ferent educations, both of which clearly
play a role in the earnings disparity,"
Heath said. "But there wasn't enough
there to come up with a solid answer to
why Michigan ranks so low in pay for
women. That was frustrating. And be-
cause the Census Bureau changed
some of its job categories in the past
decade, it wasn't really possible to show
how well women are making inroads into
higher-paying fields here."

Complaints about comparing 1990
and 2000 data items were common
headaches expressed on Census-L
traffic for more than a year.

Rising black income
Dwight Worley of The Journal News of
White Plains, N.Y., encountered chal-
lenges in reporting on the rise of the
black middle class population in New
York in general and The Journal News
circulation area in particular.

One worry: error margins. What might
look like a big change or trend could
turn out to be statistically insignificant,
depending the error margins or how
much of the data is imputed - that is,
estimated - by the Census Bureau.

"So you have to be careful - especially
when you're comparing data over sev-
eral decades," Worley said. "That's why
we stuck with using state and county-
level data, which have lower error mar-
gins than town or place level data."

To make those several-decades com-
parisons, Worley looked at income,
education, employment, poverty and
home ownership factors, from the SF3
in 2000 and from either Summary Files
3 or 4 from earlier years. He perused
PDF files on the bureau's Web site for
1990 SF4 information. Going back to
1980 and 1970 was even more diffi-
cult. He finally went to government
document libraries in New York City and
Westchester County to go through
books and microfiche images and just
plugged in numbers by hand.

Then there's the definition of a house-
hold vs. a family. Here's how the Cen-
sus Bureau divides the two groups: A
household includes all of the people
who occupy a housing unit. A family
includes a householder and others, liv-
ing in the same household, who are
related to the householder by birth,
marriage or adoption. Households,
then, may include more members than
do families. And not all households
contain families, since a household
may be composed of a group of unre-
lated people or of one person living alone.

There are tables that break down the
number of workers by family type and
the aggregate income of each type,
but not by race. Household income is
broken down by race, though, and
counts everyone - not just those who
constitute a family.

But, Worley said, even that can leave
questions. "If there are, on average,
four workers in a black household now
when there used to be only two in 1970
then that could seriously alter the analy-
sis of rising incomes. In that instance,

cluding those owned by busi-
nesses, individuals and gov-
ernment. Current through May
2002, the database allows
journalists to find the owner of
an aircraft by looking up the
registration number (com-
monly called the "N number").
This comes in handy for cov-
ering plane crashes, espe-
cially if someone can identify
the N number on the plane's
tail. The data also provides the
plane's serial number, which is
useful when searching the
FAA Service Difficulty Reports
database, also available from
NICAR, for reported mechani-
cal problems.

Income
continued from page 3

household income is rising, but it could
be because there are more workers in
the house, not necessarily because indi-
vidual blacks are earning more money."

Race, ethnicity, money
The Miami Herald found a rise in black
income in Florida. That newspaper
used median income by race and
ethnicity to make a comparison down
to the level of places that have a popu-
lation of at least 10,000.

The Census Bureau provided a
1990 table of those places and
median income.

Said The Miami Herald's Tim
Henderson: "That was fine as far as it
went, and showed us that there was a
large increase in black income in
Florida, but it wasn't reflected in our
urban county (Miami-Dade) - only in
our suburban county, Broward. There,
black income soared and reached 81 per-
cent of white non-Hispanic income, bet-
ter than anywhere else in the state."

One of the problems of using only places
and counties, he said, is that it could
mask changes in areas that weren't
marked by municipal boundaries.

"We could see this clearly when we
mapped tracts by black income,
screening for tracts with a significant
black population [at least 10 percent],"
he said. "A new regional area of black
affluence stood out clearly at the west-
ern border of the two counties, and the
ethnic makeup of those tracts made it
clear that Jamaicans were playing a
role in that new affluence. African-
Americans also dominated in the ad-
joining Dade County tracts."

Those points made a story about the
region's ethnic chemistry - a positive
note in light of the recurrent criticism
that the region has no black middle
class to provide hope and support for
the poverty-stricken inner cities,
Henderson said.

Commuting with CAR
Any movement from the middle of a city
means an increase in the number of
commuters and the time they spend on
the roads. Matt Waite followed commut-
ers in Pasco County, Fla., for the St.
Petersburg Times.

Economic demographics play a large
part in the commuter game.

"Pasco County is made up of three
distinct areas: west, central and east,"
he said. "The east is the same as it
was 40 years ago - rural. Central is
the rapidly developing area of
$150,000-plus homes. West is where
all the retirees moved in the '60s and
'70s, and they are all now dying off,
leaving their $40,000 to $60,000
homes behind. The people moving in
are 20- or 30-something, with kids."

Those moves, of course, mean an in-
teresting mix of commuters.

"You have a population of people buy-
ing low-cost homes who have to com-
mute - long distances, which is
counterintuitive," Waite said. "You ex-
pect more well-off people driving a
ways to their downtown offices. But you
don't expect to find an area with a
$23,000 median household income
driving an average of 30 minutes to
work every day."

And, like the gender gap or income
stories, the data can't tell the whole
story. In Waite's case, the big ques-
tion is where the commuter is going.
The data can only tell where the com-
muter lives.

Now journalists are awaiting the arrival
of still another data release - called
Public Use Microdata Sample, or
PUMS. Beginning with a release ten-
tatively set for December, PUMS data
is a sample of the actual responses.
With that, journalists can go beyond the
Census Bureau's cross-tabs and build
their own summary tables.

ELEVATOR SAFETY
Access forms help build
inspections database
By Mike Sherry, CQ Weekly

Elevators have become as much a
part of everyday life as cars.

But while journalists investigate many
facets of vehicle safety, such as fatal
accidents and faulty equipment, there

The state Elevator Safety Unit had an
extensive Access database that in-
cluded a lot of data, such as inspec-
tion dates and elevator locations. But
the unit was so understaffed that the
staff had no time to enter all the vio-

[Image of a Microsoft Access form titled "violations subform" with fields for "inspdate", "vioid", "viol1", "viol2", "viol3", "viol4", "reinspect", "violcode", "remarks". Record navigation is at the bottom showing "Record: 1 of 954".]
A form created in Microsoft Access was used for entering violations data from elevator inspections.

is precious little reporting about el-
evators - even though they carry mil-
lions of people every year.

So, when I came across the Missouri
Elevator Safety Board on the state
Web site, it piqued my interest. If the
state was worried enough about el-
evator safety to appoint a board to over-
see it, then perhaps a story was there.

The result was a computer-assisted
reporting story - written as part of my
master's degree final project at the
University of Missouri School of Jour-
nalism - that ran July 7 in the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch. Given that the United
States has an estimated 700,000 el-
evators, this is a story that can be rep-
licated in just about any community.

Some of the unique challenges of this
story forced me to learn important CAR
lessons that others can benefit from.

Designing databases
Using Access 97 and Access 2000, I
grappled with database design for a
relatively small database. It had many
tables, but the largest one only had
about 20,000 records. Everyone needs
to think about database design when
information must be entered from pa-
per records.

lations uncovered by inspectors. The vio-
lations were detailed in color-coded fold-
ers (with a different color for every month)
that contained more than 10,000 reports.
I took a random sample of about 260
reports that had an average of about four
violations. This gave me a good idea of
the types of problems inspectors found.

Next, I created an Access form for
data entry using a Tech Tip in the April
2000 Uplink as a guide. (Uplink ar-
ticles from 1990 to the present are
available to IRE members at
www.ire.org/resourcecenter.)

The problem, however, was that in-
spectors did not record violations
consistently. Some inspectors refer-
enced particular sections of the code
book, some just jotted down notes,
and some did both. I needed consis-
tency, however, so I could use Access
to group by and count the records to
identify the most common violations.

Learning lookups
So I created a lookup table, where I
coded each type of violation with a num-
ber. For instance, machine room door
problems got a code of "3." I linked my
data-entry form to that table, which gave
me a drop down menu each time I
needed to enter a particular violation.

Uplink

After running the queries, I found that
many elevators had serious problems
like broken phones. Machine room
doors that didn't close and lock on their
own were also hazards because
someone could walk in and be hurt or
damage equipment that could harm
passengers. This was the first time
anyone - including agency staff - evalu-
ated the seriousness of the problems.

Setting up the violation codes solved
one quandary, but another remained:
how to link the violations table with the
activity table that the Elevator Safety
Unit had created to keep track of in-
spection dates and other information.

Each elevator had a unique state ID
number, which I entered in my viola-
tions table. The problem, however,
was that each elevator often ap-
peared more than once in the activ-
ity table - mainly because the state
entered a record when that elevator
was registered, then created separate
records for the subsequent inspec-
tions. Meanwhile, each one of my vio-
lation records included the equipment
ID, so if an elevator had four violations,

MAPPING
IT OUT
The latest uses of mapping
in news reporting.

Mapping
the census
The U.S. Census Bureau's latest
big data release — long-form
questionnaire results reported
down to the tract or block group —
is keeping journalists busy as
they report the latest economic,
social and demographic trends.
(See article on page 3) Many of

the journalists have been using
geographic information system
(GIS) programs to uncover pat-
terns and changes. Here are
some recent examples from
newsrooms across the country:

Language barriers
Ron Campbell at The Orange
County Register used ArcView 3.2
and Census long-form data to find
areas with the highest concentra-
tions of residents over 14 who did
not speak English fluently. The
map he generated (Map 1) dis-
played the tracts with the highest
non-English speaking rates using
darker shades.

One Santa Ana neighborhood - with
57 percent of its population over age
14 not speaking English — had the
highest rate. Another reporter visited
the neighborhood and found resi-
dents who routinely spoke Spanish
at home, church and inside stores.

A demographer quoted in the story
noted that the neighborhood, like
some others, is the point of arrival
for new immigrants who find it easier
to adapt by living among people who
speak the same tongue.

Some residents described the ten-
sion between generations: Parents
wanted their children to speak Span-
ish, while their children wanted to
learn English.

Rich and poor
Mapping helped Garry Lenton, the
CAR coordinator at The (Harrisburg,
Pa.) Patriot-News, find pockets of
poverty in Cumberland County. The
county has one of the highest me-
dian incomes in the Harrisburg re-
gion, yet it had the third-highest pov-
erty rate increase among
Pennsylvania's 67 counties.

Lenton wanted to learn the extent of
poverty in the county's municipali-
ties. After posting a request for ad-
vice to the NICAR-L listserv, Lenton
settled on mapping the percentage
of people meeting federal poverty
guidelines by community and run-
ning the numbers of families in pov-
erty by municipality within the
newspaper's graphic. (Map 2)

Mapping by percent revealed that
some of the sparsely populated com-
munities, mainly in the rural western
portion of the county, suffered the
highest poverty rates. Reporters for

the paper later found that a boom in
the number of low-income housing
units had helped fuel the increase.

Commuting patterns
Journalists have written plenty of sto-
ries showing how affluent commut-
ers are willing to spend more time
on the road so they can have big
houses in the suburbs. Using GIS,
journalists at the Fort Worth Star-Tele-
gram discovered another pattern.

CAR specialist Jeff Claassen ana-
lyzed long-form commuting pattern
data by tract with ArcView 3.2 to iden-
tify areas where a higher percentage
of commuters left before 7 a.m. for
work. The newspaper found that
people living in low-income inner city
neighborhoods had some of the long-
est and earliest commutes (Map 3).

The Star-Telegram used its findings
for a "Your Commute" page report
dedicated to Census 2000 commut-
ing statistics for the newspaper's area.

that ID would be in four records. I
needed to modify the tables so I could
avoid a many-to-many join.

I needed a unique identifier to identify
each inspection, so I created one in
both tables. Then I ran update queries
that combined the equipment ID with
the inspection date.

Creating a violation code table and
unique IDs may seem like old hat to
CAR veterans, but for people like me
- who have not built a lot of databases
- these were good skills to learn. They
apply to any sort of story that requires
building a database or guarding
against many-to-many joins.

Finding the story
But what about the story? I found an
agency that was underfunded and un-
derstaffed. The database analysis
showed that the state had inspected
only about 40 percent of the eleva-
tors in Missouri, even though the program was created nearly a decade
ago. Additionally, of those that were
inspected, about 13 percent went
more than year before they were re-
inspected - letting potentially harm-
ful deficiencies persist.

The database
analysis showed
that the state had
inspected only 40
percent of the
elevators in
Missouri.

States handle elevator inspections dif-
ferently. Some make this a state func-
tion while others leave it up to munici-
palities. No matter who is doing it, you
will probably find an agency that lacks
the manpower to thoroughly inspect el-
evators annually. Getting a sense of the
inspection budget and inspection staff
is a starting point for this story.

Better Watchdog Workshops
Investigative Reporting on the Beat
Investigative Reporters and Editors Inc. and the Society of Professional Journalists,
with funding from the Sigma Delta Chi Foundation, have joined forces to offer a series

SPOTLIGHT: CRIME & JUSTICE
Data shows judges
set suspects free
By Joe Ellis and Brian Collister, KMOL San Antonio

Thousands of accused criminals in Bexar
County, Texas, are off the hook because
the county justice system couldn't get
their cases to court fast enough.

We broke the story after four months
of investigating, but fought more than
a year for the data. No other news or-
ganization in San Antonio had investi-
gated the Bexar County Court system
with a database of its court records.
And some county officials wanted to
make sure we didn't either.

The battle began in December 2000.
We asked for all Bexar County crimi-
nal court records to be provided elec-
tronically. We needed a complete data-
base to see how judges run their courts.

At first, the county's Information Ser-
vices Department quoted a $17,000
cost for our request, citing costly pro-
gramming since there was no existing
program for the job. After gathering
advice from the NICAR-L listserv, re-
searching the cost, and seeking help
from the state's General Services Com-
mission, we negotiated the cost down
to about $2,000. But the county folks
still dragged their feet.

Via the Texas Open Records Law, we
monitored the correspondence be-
tween county officials regarding our
request and bothered them constantly.
Agreed deadlines for providing the data
were not met. So finally, we contacted
the company that set up the county's
computer records system and hired
one of its employees to write and run
the program for $1,000. Within weeks,
we had a "flat file" we imported in to an
Access database.

Querying the data
Our first objective was to see how
tough - or lenient - the criminal court
judges were on crimes like DWI,
drugs, assaults or sex offenses. How-
ever, when we looked at the "COURT
DISPOSITION" field, we kept noticing
cases "dismissed for lack of speedy
trial." That got our attention. So we
isolated all the "DSMD-SPEEDY
TRIAL" cases, and we counted them
by the "DISPOSITION YEAR" field we
created from the "DISPOSITION
DATE" field in the data table.

We noticed a dramatic increase from the
607 cases dismissed for "lack of a
speedy trial" between 1996 and 1998
to the 5,200 cases dismissed for the
same reason from 1999 to 2001. We
decided to focus on the latter three-year
period and filtered out those 5,200
records and put them in a separate table.

Through further querying we calculated
how long these cases were on file.
Some were 15, 10, and five years old.
But it seemed strange that many would
be less than two years, or even one year
old. Law experts agreed.

We then started looking through hundreds
of individual case files, looking for an-
swers, and people to help with our story.

In those files we found victims like Vir-
ginia, who had been beaten by her hus-
band once and had a restraining order
against him when he assaulted her the
second time.

She didn't know, until we told her, that
a criminal court judge had thrown out
the case against her now ex-husband
because he didn't get a speedy trial.

A "count" query of the "OFFENSE DE-
SCRIPTION" field of our data table,
showed more than 400 other assault
cases that didn't get to court fast enough.

We also found 734 DWI-related cases
where the driver was never prosecuted,
Uplink

including the driver who hit Myrna Ellison.

"I assumed something was done,"
Ellison said.

Nothing was done, though. Even
though it was the driver's second DWI
arrest, Judge M'Liss Christian dis-
missed the case.

Christian wouldn't agree to an inter-
view, but when we caught up with her
outside the courthouse, she claimed
the misdemeanor cases she was toss-
ing didn't have victims.

The judge obviously never met Myrna
and Virginia.

Overall, we found Judge Tim Johnson,
a judge with 14 years on the bench,
tossed out the most cases with 1,528
speedy trial dismissals. Fourth-year
judge Al Alonso had 1,057 dismiss-
als, followed by seventh-year judge
Karen Crouch with 920, and Christian
with 802 dismissals.

None of these judges would agree to
an on-camera interview, but Johnson,
sent a statement on behalf of all
county court judges: "The cases dis-
missed in Bexar County are dismissed
under appropriate circumstances with
the proper procedures and are justi-
fied both by statutory and case law."

But we found the courthouse crisis
unique to Bexar County.

We checked with the Office of Court
Administration in Austin and its
records show: Harris (Houston), Dal-
las (Dallas), and Travis (Austin)
County Courts combined report only
129 cases dismissed for "lack of a
speedy trial" over the past three fiscal
years. Bexar County courts report dis-
missing close to 4,200 cases on speedy
trial grounds over the same period.

Tallying the cost
Courthouse sources explained that
the judges had created a "speedy trial
docket" in 1999, an aggressive dis-
missal procedure. On the docket,
judges choose cases they want dis-

missed and assign them to attorneys
who help get rid of them, sometimes
hundreds at a time.

For taxpayers, we found another concern.

We obtained electronic payment
records from the Bexar County
Auditor's Office. This data details how
much money each court-appointed at-
torney made in each court, case by
case, for the past five years. With the
"CASE NUMBER" field as the unique
identifier, we matched the payment
records with the speedy trial dismiss-
als for the three-year period. We soon
realized Bexar County Criminal Court
judges were using thousands and thou-
sands of dollars in public funds to get
rid of cases never even heard in court.

By joining and comparing the court
records data table and the attorney
payment records table we discovered
more than $100,000 in taxpayer money
spent by judges appointing criminal
cases on the "speedy trial docket."
Christian was tops in this category,
spending $28,076. Alonso spent
$21,446, while Crouch spent $17,623
on appointed attorneys.

We found that basically the judges by-
pass the district attorney's office and
handpick cases they want dismissed.
They also handpick attorneys to help
dismiss them. One lawyer, who asked
not to be identified in our story, de-
scribed the dismissal process.

Because of our investigation the county
commissioners met to propose plans
to stop judges from spending public
funds dismissing cases and letting ac-
cused criminals go free. The commis-
sioners created a task force to come
up with some recommendations. The
suggestions include: court coordinators
and the County Warrants Division work
together to make sure warrants are
served; judges and the district attorney
checking caseloads in criminal courts
to make sure cases are heard in a
timely manner; and fugitives being
picked up when getting a marriage li-
cense, car registration, etc.

Also, local interest groups filed com-
plaints with the Texas Commission on
Judicial Conduct asking them to inves-
tigate and publicly reprimand the
judges. The commission will not confirm
or deny any investigation in progress.

Without computer-assisted reporting,
the problem may not have been uncov-
ered. We wouldn't suggest that other
reporters will find the same problem in
their community, but we would suggest
obtaining similar data. We've produced
several stories from this data and found
it to be a valuable resource in the news-
room for enterprise reporting and daily use.

The key is doing one story at a time
and staying focused. And when re-
questing and negotiating for data,
never back down, matter how long the
process may take.

SPOTLIGHT: CRIME & JUSTICE
Analysis finds juries
lack color
By Mark Houser, (Pittsburgh) Tribune-Review

Blacks have as much right as whites
to serve on a jury, according to a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling that's more than
a century old. You might not know it from
looking in an Allegheny County jury room.

The recent Tribune-Review story "A
jury of peers?" used surveying and
GIS analysis to show how a system
that's supposedly designed to ran-
domly pick a fair cross-section of the
community for jury duty consistently
overlooks blacks.

Residents of the county's overwhelm-
ingly white neighborhoods are twice as
likely to get called for jury duty as resi-
dents of black neighborhoods, the story
showed. While blacks make up 11 per-
cent of the county's adult population,
they make up only 4 percent of those
serving on jury panels.

As a result, black defendants - who
outnumber white defendants in our
courts - often have their fates decided
by all-white juries.

It's possible that courtrooms in your
area have similar problems. Just take
a look inside jury duty rooms and see
whether the racial makeup of the ju-
rors matches the demographics from
your county's census numbers. Here's
how you can use CAR to answer some
key questions.

Surveying for race
Pick a week or two and go to the jury
room every morning before the cases
start. Ask the court administrators how
many jurors they have that day. Then
count the number of black jurors.
(When I was unsure, I briefly inter-
viewed the person and asked his race.)

When I did this over two weeks I had
counted 1,031 jurors, 4 percent of them
black. That gave me a very small margin of error, plus or minus 1.2 percent
at a 95 percent confidence interval.

Pittsburgh has almost no Hispanics, so
I did not count them. If you want to look
at Hispanics in the jury room, you have
to ask everyone his or her ethnicity. Or
you can substitute mapping analysis.

Mapping juror lists
Another way to test for fairness is to
map the addresses of people called
for jury service and see whether resi-
dents of minority neighborhoods are
as likely to be called for jury duty.
You'll need to get the court's jury ar-
ray - the list of people called to serve
each day - along with their addresses
and the dates served. Try to get a least
a year; I got 18 months of potential ju-
rors in a database.

Even in privacy-mad Pennsylvania (it
has the fourth-worst public records
laws in the United States, according to
the Better Government Association, a
nonpartisan watchdog group based in
Chicago) court administrators must
release the jury arrays.

Since the arrays document everyone
called for jury duty, not just the people
who showed up, the list is a better
measure of how well the court admin-
istrators are summoning a "fair cross-
section of the community,” as the Su-
preme Court ruling requires.

Once I had the arrays, I needed to
remove duplicate names. Our county
court jury arrays are made public 30
days before jury duty, so there are al-
ways people on it who later are
granted a postponement. Those
people then show up months later on
another array when they're resched-
uled for duty. To find them, I sorted
by last names and street names, then
made a separate column with an
Uplink

"=IF" test to see if a cell repeated the
one above it. (For details see sidebar
on page 12).

With the duplicates removed from the
data, I was ready to geocode those
addresses and create a point map
showing the residences of the poten-
tial jurors. ArcView 3.2, using Census
TIGER street files, matched about 91
percent of the addresses off the bat. I
got the match rate up to 99 percent by
fixing mistakes in addresses, using the
StreetMap geocoding extension and
manually plotting particularly trouble-
some addresses.

Once I had created the shapefile of
45,000 juror points, I overlaid it onto a
census block group layer with Census
2000 demographics. After that, I
opened the attribute table for the po-
tential jurors and block group layers
and performed a spatial join to append
the demographic data to the juror layer.
Then I used the Summarize function
to count the potential juror points in-
side each block group.

Using the Census 2000 race demo-
graphics for block groups, I created an
Excel spreadsheet with two key num-
bers for each: the percent of the adult
population that is black, and the num-
ber of jurors per 1,000 adults population,
which I called the "jury service ratio."

The average jury service ratio in block
groups that were at least 98 percent
white was 53 per 1,000. The average
ratio in block groups that were at least
50 percent black was 26 per 1,000.
There was my lede: Black neighbor-
hood residents were half as likely to
be called for jury duty. I selected 98
percent white to make sure I excluded
suburban neighborhoods where a sig-
nificant number of blacks also live. I
calculated similar numbers for the
county's 130 municipalities, so I could
refer to them in stories and graphics,
because nobody knows what block
group he lives in.

I calculated them for most of
Pittsburgh's neighborhoods. Like
many cities, Pittsburgh has several

black and white enclaves. Instead of
saying that in Pittsburgh 32 of 1,000
adults got called for jury duty, it was
more telling to say that 20 did in
(black) Larimer, and 57 did in (white)
Regent Square.

If you have clearly defined Hispanic
neighborhoods, you might be able to
use GIS analysis to make up for diffi-
culties in using jury room surveys to
identify Latinos.

Explaining patterns
If you find the similar results, the next
step is to determine why. This was
the most difficult part of the story,
and I only was able to suggest some
possibilities.

Most jury pools are picked by com-
puter from voter rolls and driver's li-
censes lists. Many people say, "Aha!
Blacks don't vote as often as whites."
Maybe. But according to a Census
Bureau study of the 2000 election,
blacks register at almost the same
rate as whites. "Motor Voter" laws pre-
vent election authorities in Pennsyl-
vania from regularly purging voter
rolls, so the lists are useless in trying
to see if black neighborhoods have
fewer registered voters.

License records in Pennsylvania lack
a racial designation for drivers. And the
state Department of Transportation is
hyper-secretive about those records so
it is impossible to check if there are
fewer licenses per adult population in
black neighborhoods.

I found a very likely culprit for the jury
pool discrepancies by looking else-
where. The jury commission sends
"qualifying questionnaires" to the
people its computer picks to make
sure they will be able to serve. A third
of those never come back. The com-
mission ignores the non-responses,
even though at least half of them are
returned because of a wrong address
- in other words, the commission fails
keep its address records current.

We know from the census that blacks
in the county are more likely to rent.
Renters move more often. Ergo,
blacks are more likely to be missed
by the jury commission because of a
recent move.

The commission does an even worse
job finding people in the neighbor-
hood around the University of Pitts-
burgh. Residents there are mainly
students, and they move every year.
Only 10 adults per 1,000 in the Pitt
neighborhood got called for jury duty.

Is that another story? Not likely. The
Supreme Court has ruled that people
can't challenge a jury room for being
disproportionately old.

mhouser@tribweb.com.

Checking for duplicates in Excel

To find duplicates in the list of people
called to jury duty, I sorted the list by last
name, first name, and street name. Then
I ran an "=IF" test on all three to see if
the value in one cell was the same as in
the cell below it.

This statement shows you if the last
name is duplicated in the cell below for
the spreadsheet pictured here:

=IF(A2=B2, "dup","")

If there is a duplication, Excel inserts the
word "dup" the cell. I calculated a simi-
lar formula for first names and streets.
Then by filtering I could find the triple
"dups" and delete them, leaving only one
record for the person. I checked double
"dups" and if they appeared to be true
duplicates, I deleted them.

In this example Carolyn Messenger is
a triple "dup."
She was ini-
tially sum-
moned in
March 2002
and then sum-
moned again
two months
later. That
means she
postponed her
first jury duty
summons, be-
cause you
can't serve
twice in a
year. I deleted
that row.

[Image of an Excel spreadsheet showing a list of names and addresses with a column used to identify duplicates.]

Lynda Smith has two addresses. I can't
know if she's a duplicate from this list,
or if there are two Lynda Smiths, so I
let both records stay.

Robert Sommer shows that it's important
to use first names too. There are two
Sommers from Galway Drive, but one's
Robert and one's Roselyn. Both stayed.

CAR INVESTIGATIONS
Elder care homes
ripe for probes
By Stephanie Kang, IRE and NICAR

As America's elderly population ex-
plodes, journalists use database re-
porting to explore the state of assisted
living centers and nursing homes
around the country.

At just more than 20 years old, the as-
sisted living industry is still relatively
new. Arising out of dissatisfaction with
nursing homes, assisted living centers
cater to the elderly with financial means
and little need of intensive nursing
care. Yet because they are regulated
by states, not by the federal govern-
ment as most nursing homes are,
monitoring assisted living care can
become difficult. Assisted living centers
and nursing homes have come under
fire for lax regulation, understaffing,
and patient abuse and neglect.

Months of anecdotal stories from state
inspectors prompted Milwaukee Journal
Sentinel reporter Mary Zahn to investi-
gate the conditions of Wisconsin as-
sisted living centers. A six-month inves-
tigation resulted in "Overwhelmed and
Broken Down: Caring for the Elderly and
Disabled," published in August 2001.
Zahn used Wisconsin's open records
law to obtain a database of state inspec-
tions and citations against nursing
homes and assisted living centers. The
series found that hundreds of elderly and
disabled people in assisted living facili-
ties had been injured and put at risk. In
addition, 10,000 of the state's disabled
or elderly residents had been forced to
wait for months or even years to move
into an assisted living facility. (Story No.
18778 in the IRE Resource Center)

Reporters for The Oregonian built and
used existing databases while investi-
gating the assisted living industry, fo-
cusing on Keren Wilson and the com-
pany she created, Assisted Living Con-
cepts. For a series that ran in June
2001, they built several databases to
track investigations of centers run by the
company, entering information from in-
vestigative reports. They also tailored a
complaints database that they got from
the Oregon Senior and Disabled Ser-
vices Division. An analysis of the data
showed that Assisted Living Concepts
had a track record that was worse than
the state average. (Story No. 18972)

In "Who Will Care For Them? Ohio's
Elder Crisis" the Dayton Daily News
examined how Ohio cares for its eld-
erly. The Daily News analyzed more
than a half dozen state regulatory da-
tabases with FoxPro and SPSS. Some
of the databases had never been pub-
licly available in Ohio and the report-
ers had to negotiate with health depart-
ment officials to obtain them.

The Daily News discovered a system
"dangerously under-scrutinized,”
where the elderly often are forced to
choose between costly assisted living
care centers and state-funded nursing
homes. The Daily News also found that
state inspection personnel reductions
and a 70 percent decrease in citations
for serious health and safety violations
threatened to minimize the state's influence
on a sub-par facility (Story No. 15917)

In the questionnaire that accompanies
their stories in the IRE Resource Cen-
ter, the reporters advise: "Data is virtu-
ally limitless. Don't get overwhelmed.
Use it to answer your questions, not
for fishing expeditions."

Finding data
For starters, federal law mandates that
state regulators keep registries of aides
working in every assisted living center
and nursing home.

Nursing Home Compare data
(www.medicare.gov/nhcompare/
home.asp) allows you to check indi-
Uplink

vidual nursing homes in your area or
download information to build your own
database. The Online Survey Certifi-
cation and Reporting file (OSCAR) at
www.longtermcareinfo.com/crg/
about_oscar.html is an administrative
database of the Health Care Financ-
ing Administration. OSCAR provides
survey and data. That means every
institutional health-care provider in the
United States that is certified to pro-
vide services under either Medicare or
Medicaid (or both) is listed in OSCAR.
Because different types of providers
have to report different information dur-
ing the survey and certification pro-
cess, OSCAR results can vary.

Journalists also have access to com-
plaint investigation forms. In Missouri,
the Social Services Department Divi-
sion on Aging regulates nursing homes
and maintains a "Statement of Defi-
ciencies and Plan of Correction"
record. Most state health departments
will maintain a complaints and enforce-
ment database.

Look for datasets that lay out Medic-
aid and Medicare eligibility for nursing
homes and assisted living centers, as
well as a costs database, also from the
Health Department.

These departments usually adminis-
ter inspections and give licenses for
adult care centers, adult residential
care homes, intermediate care and
skilled nursing centers. These
datasets may include facility surveys,
and provide operator information and
resident demographics.

For details about the stories by the
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and The
Oregonian, see the feature package
about investigating assisted living cen-
ters in the November/December 2002
issue of The IRE Journal. Also included
are tips and sources for covering as-
sisted living and examples of other el-
der housing stories that used CAR.

their data, which outlines crime totals
and details homicides. The database
also contains information about law
enforcement agencies and officers,
and demographics of people arrested
for major crimes.

A useful companion is the National
Crime Victimization Survey, a Depart-
ment of Justice report based on a
household survey designed to estimate
the incidence of crimes such as theft rob-
bery, assault and burglary. Journalists
can use the data to estimate crimes that
may not have been reported to law en-
forcement. Be aware that the crime re-
porting categories differ. Kurt Silver com-
pares the uses of FBI data and the NCVS
in "Understanding Crime Statistics,"
available from the IRE Resource Center.

Reporters have also used CAR to fol-
low suspects through the courts. Jour-
nalists at The Chicago Reporter cre-
ated a database of judicial appeals to
help track a police unit's homicide con-
victions. A neighborhood coalition
claimed the police regularly relied on
faulty eyewitnesses. The database was
used to write the 2000 series called
"Seeking Justice."

Electronic court records give reporters
the power to evaluate outcomes in the
justice system. Although most court
documents are open unless a judge says
otherwise, some state and federal courts
have resisted providing full electronic
access to data. The (Wilmington, Del.)
News-Journal asked for 10 years of
felony and misdemeanor data in 1997
to investigate repeat offenders. The pa-
per won limited data after dropping iden-
tifying details from the request and prom-
ising not to use the data to find individu-
als. The paper still had to sue to get in-
formation on repeat offender status. A
recent court ruling upheld that request
but denied access to records for arrests
that did not end in convictions.

Some state records laws address elec-
tronic court records explicitly. See how
your access law treats courts in Tapping
Official Secrets, a Reporters Committee
for the Freedom of the Press publication
at www.rcfp.org/tapping/index.cgi.

nal justice issues and other back-

Tech tip...
Stitching points, data when GIS address matches fail
By James E. Wilkerson, The (Allentown, Pa.) Morning Call

One of our reporters recently
wanted to get a visual picture of
shootings around housing projects
over a few months and came to me,
because he know that I am using
ArcView for mapping. What
sounded like a simple project -
plotting a list of shooting locations
onto a street map of Allentown -
turned out much more difficult than
imagined, mostly because the lo-
cation data was inconsistent.

Instead of having an exact street
address, the shooting location field
often contained an intersection or
general block on which the shoot-
ing occurred. Geocoding didn't
seem to be an option, at least not
for the precise placement wanted.
But because we were looking at
only a couple dozen incidents, I de-
cided to map them by hand.

First, I added a map shapefile of
city streets that the city's GIS de-
partment provided. This street map
- like many created by municipal
agencies - is more often updated
and corrected than the TIGER map-
ping files provided by the U.S. Cen-
sus Bureau. The data did not in-
clude housing project boundaries,
so reporter Keith Herbert and I
drove to them and jotted down the
streets around the perimeter of the
projects. Later, in ArcView 8, we
created a new layer for the poly-
gon boundary.

Using computerized crime data
provided by the city police depart-
ment, I created a spreadsheet con-
taining the incidents to map as
points. Each record had basic in-
formation about the shooting and
a unique identifier that I created,
something needed to create a point
map. I saved that to a dBASE file and
added it as a table to the project.

[Image of a "Create New Shapefile" dialog box in a GIS application. Name is "New Shapefile", Feature Type is "Point".]

Then I got stuck trying to figure out
how to join the crimes to points on
the city map. After posting a query
on the NICAR and ESRI listservs,
several people suggested that I
create a new point file with no data
and join it to the list of shootings.

Here are the steps:
With streets and project layers in a
view, I created a new, separate
shapefile. In ArcView 8, you do that
in the ArcCatalog application. Right
click on the drive location where you
want to store it and choose New/
Shapefile. Name the file and make
sure that it is a point file.

After adding the point shapefile to
a view in ArcMap, open its attribute
table and you will see that it is
empty, except for three fields.

Second, I opened the dBASE file
of shooting incidents and arranged
the table window and map window
so I could see both. With the new
shapefile opened for editing, I used
the Create New Feature pointer
tool. For each shooting location
listed in the dBASE file, I created
a point on the map that was as
close as possible to the location
described. Each time I clicked on
the map to add a new point,
ArcMap created a new record in
the shapefile.

To avoid confusion, I worked with
one point at a time. I copied the
unique ID number of the shooting
into the ID field of my new point
shapefile, periodically saving the file.

In a couple of hours, I had a new
map of about two dozen shooting
locations, which I then joined to
the file of shooting data on the
common ID field for further analy-
sis. The dBASE file and new
shapefile could also be merged
into one file, if you prefer, but I
kept mine separate.

Unfortunately, the story never made
it to print as we originally envisioned
it, but the map gave us the ability to
add new analysis to the subject, which
was essential in deciding whether the
story was worth pursuing.

est, including the date of the accident,
whether alcohol was involved and
whether there were any injuries. State
lawyers cited another law that re-
quires the to withhold the identities of
accident victims.

In appealing these rulings, The Inquirer
succeeded in getting PennDOT to re-
lease data at the town level, which al-
lowed an analysis of trends in accidents
by town and county over a five-year
period. That data, however, did not
identify any roads. We still did not know
the worst areas in the region for alco-
hol-related crashes.

For that, we had to rely on backdoor
methods. Working through sources
within the department, we were able
to work around PennDOT's secrecy
policy. We obtained data that located
accidents on state roads in five-mile
road segments. The table also included
the total for a five-year period of alco-
hol-related accidents and fatalities.
With that information, we were able to
calculate the road segments with the
highest per mile rate of alcohol-related
accidents. That analysis gave us our
first look at the worst roads for alco-
hol-related accidents. Once we had this
data, we appealed to the state to release
the latest year's data. By publication, we
had road specific accident data for the
most recent five-year period.

Creating 'hot spots'
Using ArcView 8.1, we mapped the ac-
cident data and revealed for the first
time roads with above-average accident
rates. We focused the story on state
Route 3, a 25-mile stretch that extends
from Philadelphia into its western sub-
urbs that included a segment with the
highest accident rate at 22 per mile.

Working from paper records that we
had accumulated from police and other
sources, we found alcohol-related ac-
cidents that had occurred on Route 3
in which people had been killed.
Through our reporting, we also located
other accidents that had occurred on
the very roads that police knew had
high alcohol-related crash rates and
where bars were concentrated. In
some cases, they were located in
towns where police made relatively few
arrests for drunken driving. The trag-
edy of drunken driving was told through
the stories of the victims who had been
killed and injured.

Drunken Driving:
The Worst Spots
For Accidents
The Inquirer analyzed five years' of accident data to pinpoint the most
dangerous stretches of road. State roads with highest rates of alcohol-related
accidents and fatalities between 1996 and 2000. Also shown for 2000 accidents are sections on Inter-
state 95 with five or more alcohol-related crashes.
The roads
Route 3, from West Chester to Philadelphia, had the most dangerous five-mile
sections, typically five-miles long, based on per mile crash rates. Delaware
County had 10 of the most dangerous sections in the region between 1996 and 2000.
For example, a two-mile section of Route 3, near the Blue Route, had the highest
rate in the area. That part of the road also had more than 20
crashes per mile, the second highest of any Inter-county area.
The map shows only sections of state roads. A similar analysis of local streets and
county roads could not be done because accident locations were not available.

Next, we obtained liquor license data
from the state's Liquor Control Board.
In this case, using ArcView's Spatial
Analyst extension worked much bet-
ter than producing an ArcView map.
Mapping the 4,000 establishments by
plotting each location produced a
map of little value. Likewise, a shade
map of license counts by town was
also misleading since it would have
incorrectly given the impression that
licenses were evenly distributed
across a town when in reality they
were generally clumped in older, es-
tablished neighborhoods.

We wanted to generate a map show-
ing the liquor license "hot spots." The
best tool turned out to be Spatial Ana-
lyst, using the actual locations of the
point data to generate the "hot spots"
in just the area of the map where the
liquor licenses were concentrated, giv-
ing a much more accurate rendition.

The result was a map that displayed
concentrations of liquor establishments
from two to six or more per square mile.
The more liquor establishments, the
darker the ring.

When layered with the accident data,
we were able to identify the same link
between crashes and liquor establish-
ments that researchers had come up
with in California. While crashes have
many causes — road design, weather,
speed - those involving alco-
hol happened most where
bars and restaurants are con-
centrated.

This link was especially im-
portant in Pennsylvania. A
new law makes it possible to
sell liquor licenses within
counties. Previously, a popu-
lation-based quota had re-
stricted licenses to the towns
in which they were already lo-
cated, resulting in a concen-
tration of drinking establish-
ments in older, more densely
populated neighborhoods.

Our analysis accounted for
traffic volume. We found that
some of the busiest roads did not
have the highest accident rates. Parts
of Interstate 95 had the most traffic
in the region - but not nearly the high-
est rates of alcohol-related crashes.
We also learned that using traffic
count data was flawed because traf-
fic counts are usually taken during the
daytime, while alcohol-related
crashes were more likely to occur
between 8 p.m. and 4 a.m.

Because we were new to density analy-
sis, we also consulted several experts
including Paul J. Gruenewald of the
Pacific Institute for Research and
Evaluation (www.pire.org) who had
done research in California studies.

For those of you who want to know
more about how Spatial Analyst
works, here's a brief summary from
ESRI's "Using ArcGIS Spatial Ana-
lyst:" Spatial Analyst calculates den-
sity by spreading point values over a
surface. A density value is calculated
for each cell in the output raster.

Points that fall within the search area
are summed and then divided by the
search area size to get each cell's
density value. We elected to calcu-
late density using the kernel calcula-
tions because points at the center of
the raster cell's search area are
weighted more heavily than those
near the edge. The result is a
smoother distribution of values.

Mapping put online
For online, Matthew Ericson, senior
editor for Web technology, designed
an interactive map using ESRI's
ArcIMS Internet map server, which
allowed readers to zoom in on the
most dangerous roads in the region
and see the total number of alcohol-
related crashes, the number of alco-
hol-related fatalities and the per mile
crash rate.

The Web site (www.philly.com/mld/in-
quirer/news/special_packages/dui)
included a number of interactive tools
that allowed our readers to go beyond
what we printed in the newspaper and
see how DUI affects their lives. A
blood alcohol calculator lets readers
enter their weight and gender to see
how many drinks it takes to reach
various levels of impairment.

In addition to the accident/liquor li-
cense analysis, the project included
an analysis of police arrest data by
town. Calculating a per 10,000 arrest
rate and dividing the results into
quintiles allowed us to compare po-
lice department performance. Read-
ers could also look up their town in a
searchable database to find detailed
information on the number of alcohol-
related crashes by town and by
county, and arrests by town, by
county, by arrest rate and per police
officer. The project included the
analysis of other data from courts in
two states and Philadelphia and cam-
paign contributions.

Recent stories include:
• "Justice Undone," by The
(Baltimore) Sun. The paper
investigated more than 1,400
murders between 1997 and
2001 and found that two-thirds
of the time, either no one was
arrested, or the people who were
arrested went free or were sent
to jail for short periods of time
on lesser charges.

• "Prosecutors' conviction rate
falls," by The Wichita Eagle. The
Eagle analyzed more than
14,000 court cases in Sedgwick
County District Court and found
a decline in conviction rates.
Meanwhile, not guilty verdicts in
felony trials more than tripled
from 1999 to 2001. Sources
attributed the changes to
charging some people with
crimes more serious than the
evidence supported, and to
inexperience among prosecutors.

• "Who's Watching the Deputies?
Patronage at work in the sheriff's
department," by the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch. Reporters found
that some deputies in the St.
Louis sheriff's department who
didn't show up for work got paid
anyway. The paper also found
five men working as deputies,
even though they had been
rejected when they applied for
security guard licenses.

GIS
continued from page 1

Other journalists are running into the
same problems Washburn has expe-
rienced. The privatization of govern-
ment functions and amendments to
public records laws has hampered
access to GIS data. He said that be-
cause SanGIS was initially funded by
taxpayer money and backed by the
county it should be more reasonable
with its prices.

"I totally think they are breaking the law
by doing this because it involves tax-
payer money," said Washburn, an in-
vestigative reporter. SanGIS contends
that because it is now self-sustaining,
its prices are reasonable and reflect
the time and effort it takes to digitize
the county layers.

Journalists are finding that, along with
charging high costs for GIS data, the
departments have basically cornered
the market. While some private busi-
nesses such as real estate or law firms
may be able to afford the data, most
news organizations lack the money.

Laws increase costs
While the GIS costs in San Diego
County are one extreme, journalists
have encountered a spectrum of diffi-
culties and costs when attempting to
obtain GIS data from government
agencies. The availability and cost of
GIS data depends on the location, pub-
lic records laws and who's reviewing
the request for data.

Part of the reason Dan Keating, da-
tabase editor at The Washington
Post, first began using GIS data was
because it was so easily accessible
from county GIS departments in
Florida, where he had worked before.
"Both Miami-Dade and Broward
counties gave me CDs with dozens
and dozens of local GIS layers for
practically nothing, no more than
$50," Keating said.

That changed once he left The Mi-
ami Herald and began working in

Washington, D.C. While costs for data
from the District and Virginia counties
were reasonable, he said, obtaining
GIS data from agencies in Maryland
proved to be a nightmare. "The state
has an exemption to its public records
law for GIS, saying that it can be sold
for market cost. So layers from a
county can cost thousands of dollars,"
Keating said.

Maurice Tamman, staff writer at The At-
lanta Journal-Constitution, has had
troubles dealing with GIS laws. While
working on a story requiring parcel
maps, Tamman requested GIS data
from Forsyth County and was quoted
a price of more than $10,000 for the
maps he was seeking.

A recently enacted Georgia law
gives agencies the authority to
charge for GIS data based upon the
actual recovery and development
time involved with the GIS. Tamman
said the county follows this new law
to the letter.

Meanwhile, he was able to receive the
same type of GIS data from a neigh-
boring county absolutely free. "It is in-
teresting to me, because traditionally
we view any data produced by the
government as being fundamentally
free," Tamman said. "But GIS has
been placed on a pedestal because
it has some intrinsic market value."

Fighting some battles
Some reporters have gone head-to-
head with government agencies
challenging fees based on outra-
geous standards. While many of
these journalists bear the battle
scars, some have the GIS data to
show for it as well.

Paula Sullivan, city hall reporter and
computer-assisted reporting coordina-
tor at The (Tacoma, Wash.) News Tri-
bune, went around in circles trying to
negotiate with Pierce County for some
GIS data. The agency's going rate was
$60 per shapefile, when all they had
to do to produce the files was copy
ones already created.

"State law does not allow them to do
this, so we complained to the county
executive and - instead of trying to
negotiate a reasonable price - they
gave it to us free just that once,"
Sullivan said.

Since that initial dispute, she said
they have received other files from
the county. "However, the department
continues to charge the $60 rate to
others and makes them sign all sorts
of forms, including a data-sharing
agreement that we have always re-
fused to sign."

"...GIS has been
placed on a
pedestal because it
has some intrinsic
market value."

While some journalists have had to
fight government agencies to lower
costs for GIS data, others have
found GIS departments to be
friendly, helpful, and even willing to
provide free data.

Although Sullivan had to convince one
Washington county to give her data,
she said dealing with the city of Tacoma
is a different story. This city posts many
of its most-accessed shapefiles on its
Web site, free to any user with an
Internet connection.

With the recent explosion in the use
of GIS, more state, local and fed-
eral agencies have been putting
GIS data on their Web sites for free
download.

More experiences
John McCarthy, a reporter at Florida
Today, had a good experience with
one state agency.

McCarthy requested GIS layers of
Florida's coastline to analyze how vul-
nerable those areas would be to hurri-
canes. Florida's Emergency Opera-
tions Center provided the data quickly.
"Their GIS specialist spent quite a bit
of time on the phone with me working
out bugs and was very cheerful about
it," he said.

Other journalists have had to give in
just a little to receive the shapefiles and
layers that they needed. Maricopa
County, Ariz., was willing to give Enric
Volante, CAR coordinator and data-
base reporter at the Arizona Daily Star,
GIS data for free, but only if he signed
a liability waiver.

"First time in my many years of jour-
nalism that I ever signed a liability
waiver in order to get a public record,"
Volante said. "I also filed a formal pro-
test, but they didn't seem to understand
what all the fuss was about."

John Hill, systems editor at The
(Vancouver, Wash.) Columbian, has
received just about all of the GIS data
a newsroom could need from the
Clark County GIS department. The
newspaper paid $1,200 per year for
two CDs that include school district
boundaries and soil contours. "While
it does seem like a lot of money, when
we have a GIS project going it's all
money well spent," Hill said.

While many journalists have been able
to get their hands on the data they
need, there are still some like Tamman
and Washburn who have been com-
pletely shut off from the data because
of the high prices GIS departments
demand.

"It is certainly putting a roadblock to
somebody trying to do their job,"
Tamman said. "I couldn't do some of
those stories I wanted to do. Whether
it'll stop me from trying, though, that's
another story."
