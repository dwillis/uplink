In Ohio, you can drink, drive,
be convicted, serve time and drive
drunk again as many times as you
want. Your driver's license may be
temporarily suspended, but with a
little time and $75 you can buy it
back.

This is what reporters at the
Dayton Daily News found as they
prepared their series on drunken
driving in Ohio.

In their series, Russell Carollo,
Sandy Theis and Mizzell Stewart
recounted the cases of people in
Ohio who had the largest number
of Driving Under the Influence
violations and how those people
said time in jail wouldn't stop them
from committing another DUI
violation.

One man who has been con-
victed at least 19 times of drunken
driving says that when he gets out

Is government copyright, or wrong?

Should Morrela-Rockefeller amendment
allow government to copyright software?

On the face of it, an amend-
ment to the Stevenson-Wydler Act
to allow copywriting of govern-
ment-developed software is not
something likely to electrify the
next editorial board meeting.

In fact, most newsrooms
would be hard pressed to see any
connection between the amend-
ment and their efforts to cover
government.

However, this obscure pro-
posed amendment to an equally
obscure federal law illustrates the
new challenges facing the press as
government shifts from storing
records on paper to storing them on
computers.

The current version of the
Stevenson-Wydler Technology
Innovation Act makes it profitable
for private companies to use dis-
coveries that are jointly developed
with government labs
partner-
ships known as cooperative research

In June,
N.T.I.S. made the
1989 TRI available
on computer tape.
We have found a
way to make using
these tapes irresist-
ible. MICAR has
produced A Re-
porters Working
Guide to the Toxic
Release Inventory.

TRI working guide still available

The Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Release Inventory
(TRI) has been one of the most popular databases used by the readers of
UPLINK. It has been the source of excellent industrial pollution stories
in Florida, California, Connecticut, Ohio and elsewhere.

In June, N.T.I.S. made the 1989 TRI available on computer tape.
We have found a way to make using these tapes irresistible. MICAR has
produced A Reporters Working Guide to the Toxic Release Inventory.

This guide helps reporters download TRI into their computers, or-
ganize the data so that it is usable, and manipulate the data to produce
meaningful reports

And because specific SQL commands are included, reporters
using the guide will be able to:

— identify the major polluters in their area.
— list the quantities of toxic chemicals discharged by state,
county or zip code.

The guide, which is really all you need if you already own the TRI
database, costs $30 by itself. But for $50, MICAR will also include the
NineTrack Express record profiles needed to download TRI.

If you do not own TRI, cannot afford it, or simply do not have a
tape drive, for $350 MICAR will also supply TRI data concerning your
entire state on 3.5" diskettes.

Finally, if you wish to purchase the entire TRI database on com-
puter tape, MICAR can supply it for $500. To order call MICAR at
(314) 882-0684.

New company reaches E.P.I.C. proportions

Electronic Public Information Consultants, a com-
pany geared towards obtaining, analyzing and reporting
on electronically stored government records, has begun
operations in Seattle.

According to co-owner Adam Berliant, E.P.I.C. is
targeting news organizations, but expects to work for
others in the public sector who utilize public informa-
tion.

"We are able to do far more complex analyses of
government data than one is able to do online," Berliant
said.

Berliant is joined by Tom Braden and David Hinch-
man as owners of the new business. All three are recent
graduates of the University of Missouri School of Jour-
nalism.

id. development agreements, or
CRADAS.

The law permits the govern--
ment to obtain patents on inven-
tions, resulting from CRADAS.
Federal employees who help de-
velop the innovations share in the
royalties, and private industry re-
ceives a license on the government's
patents to develop commercial
products.

While the law allows the
government to hold patents, it does
not cover copyrights. Current
copyright law prohibits the federal
government from applying for
copyright protection for its works,
including software.

One-sixth of the country's
scientists and engineers work at the
more than 700 government-run
boratories. Rep. Connie Morella
-Md.) and Sen. John Rockefeller
(D-W.Va.) reasoned that by en-
couraging the private sector to form
CRADAS, this country could pro-
tect a valuable lead it has in com-
puter technology. Both have sub-
mitted legislation that would ex-
tend the Stevenson-Wydler Act to
include copyright protection for
CRADA-produced software. The
identical bills are currently wind-
ing their way through Congress.

What does this bill have to
do with a reporter's access to infor-
mation?

Everything.

Electronic data is rapidly
becomming the dominant form of
record keeping in the United States.
The Federal government, at last
unt, had over 30,000 mainframes
ad mini-computers storing infor-

mation on everything from crop
reports to cancer research. This
means that if reporters want to do
their jobs, they will have to know
how to obtain and use electronic
records. While electronic infor-
mation is similar to its paper-
counterpart, there are significant
differences — differences which
the bills of Morella and
Rockefeller, despite their good
intentions, do not address.

When a reporter requests a
paper record from a government
agency, there is an assumption
that is so well accepted that it
goes unstated: the information will
be in English. Not so electronic
information, which has no ac-
cepted form for electronic rec-
ords.

There are two different
coding schemes (ASCII and
EBCDIC), at least four different
methods of recording informa-
tion on magnetic tape, and a seem-
ingly endless number of record
formats. What is crucial to note
here is that the form in which
information is recorded on a tape
is controlled by the software. This
makes it exceedingly easy for a
government agency to keep its
records secret by hiding behind
the protection of the Morella-
Rockefeller amendment.

With the help of a private
company, an agency could de-
velop database software that uses
a proprietary scheme for storing
information. When reporters ask
for a copy of the government's
database, the agency would gladly

You want to
check the govern-
ment's figures, but
to do so, you have to
use the govern-
ment's software. In
fact, you want to
check out the soft-
ware, not just the
figures it produces.
That's impossible,

in-demand software
can be available is —
you guessed it —

oblige. If reporters complain that
they can't decipher the way the
information is stored, the agency
can say, "Sorry, the copyrighted
instructions for deciphering the
information are not public."

This is not to say that Morella
and Rockefeller are trying to up-
end the concept of open govern-
ment. Proponents of the amend-
ment argue that only the software
will be copyrighted, not the data.

Software in this view is the
mechanical version of a clerk that
retrieves, sorts, counts, indexes and
stores information as if it were paper
records.

The distinction between
software and data is likely to be-
come even more tenuous as in-
creasingly powerful software pro-
grams are developed. What do we
make of artificial intelligence (AI)
software, where the knowledge base
is built into the software as a series
of general rules? Are the rules
software, data, or something else?
Even more esoteric is software that
"learns," that develops its own rules
as it examines information.

Is it likely that government
will be working with such exotic
software? If the Morella-Rockefeller
amendment is passed, that is pre-
cisely the kind of software that the
bill's proponents envision.

One way out of this thicket is
to copyright the software but re-
quire the government to provide
public access to the information.
This rings hollow. The use will be
free only if you are using a goverm-
ment computer loaded with the
government's copyrighted software
in the government's building. 1...
will be the stand-in-line use, the
you-can't-take-it-home-or-to-the-
office use. This will be a use de-
void of much convenience and
solitude.

For the importance of timeli-
ness, imagine this scenario: The
government, shortly before an
important election, has released new
figures on the "negative growth
incline" (recession) which show
that the economy has turned around
to such an extent tht the U.S. will
have a projected 10-percent posi-
tive growth by the end of the year.
The government's new, copyrighted
software made the analysis pos-
sible. Phenomenal figures, you
think. Impossible, in fact.

You want to check the gov
ernment's figures, but to do so,,
have to use the government's soft-
ware. In fact, you want to check
out the software, not just the fig-
ures it produces. That's impos-
sible, you are told. The first time
the much-in-demand software can
be available is - you guessed it
after Election Day.

The Morella-Rockefeller
amendment should be seen as a
signal flare in every newsroom in
America. If we do not develop a
national policy on access to elec-
tronic information, we may wake
up one morning to a closed society.
"We would love to give you that
information," the clerk explains,
"but it's on a computer."

Computer-assisted reporting

The cost of doing business

Jennifer Wynn
MICAR

The cost of computerized
information may be a stumbling block
for some medium- and small-circu-
lation papers interested in doing
computer-assisted reporting.

That's the problem that Jane
Martin, a reporter at the Corpus Christi
Caller-Times, encountered while
doing a drunk driving story for the
72,000 circulation daily.

"I was laboriously working
by notebook going over old (crimi-
nal court) files when I realized that
we ought to buy the tape," she said.

Martin talked to her boss and
told her to find out how much the
-nine-track magnetic tape would cost.

The tape, which contained
criminal case filings from 1985 to
1989, cost $784.

"That's when I ran into a
roadblock," she said.

Because the county's com-
puter system is older, additional
programming was required before
the Caller-Times could obtain the
tapes. The extra programming in-
creased the overall cost of the tapes,
according to Martin.

But what happened to Mar-
tin doesn't have to happen to report-
ers at all small papers. Pat Stith, re-
porter for the News & Observer in
Raleigh, N.C., said that most tapes
acquired by the paper from state and
unty governments have cost about
0. "Our most expensive tapes were
the Federal Election Commission
tapes for $417," he said.

"We've gotten some tapes
for nothing," Stith said. "(In) some
places we've pulled out a few disk-
ettes, popped them into the computer
and had the information in minutes.

According to Martin, smaller
towns may also be reluctant to pro-
vide the information on magnetic.
tape because they are not familiar
with FOIA requests and FOIA law.

"They say no without know-
ing what they're saying no to," Martin
said.

Under the Texas Open Rec-
ords Law, a judge decides how and
in what format government docu-
ments will be released.

In Martin's case, she met with
the district judge, a clerk and the
sheriff to talk about her request.

"I told them I was not look-
ing for subjective information about
juveniles or anything else,” Martin
said.

Once they understood the
request, they released the informa-
tion, she said.

Reporters have to go through
that process with every agency they
approach, Stith said.

"Each time we've gone to a
new agency it's been a new ball-
game," Stith said. "We've done very
little repeat business so far but when
we go back, things go smoothly."

Stith also advises newspa-
pers to look for a central processing
agency that handles the computer
chores for the city, county or state,

What happened to
Martin doesn't have
to happen to report-
ers at all small pa-
pers. Pat Stith, re-
porter for the News &
Observer in Raleigh,
N.C., said that most
tapes acquired by the
paper from state and
county governments
have cost about $30.

Under the Texas
Open Records Law, a
judge decides how
and in what format
government docu-
ments will be re-
leased.

because it saves time and more im-
portantly cuts costs.

Newspapers starting a com-
puter-assisted reporting program
should try to get one 486 computer
with a gigabyte hard drive, because it
will give them the capability to do a
large database project and run pro-
grams quickly, Stith said.

For Martin's drunk driving
story, two computer systems at the
Caller-Times were used. The 6250
BPI tape was downloaded into three
smaller tapes at 6250 BPI. Then
programmers downloaded these tapes
into a database on a Hewlett-Packard
3000 mainframe. After that they
downloaded the information onto a
386 PC with a 100 megabyte hard-
drive.

Ray Motta, manager of
erations at the Caller-Times, said the
newspaper leases its equipment-
one mainframe, four word proces-
sors, five disk drives and four tape
drives.

Martin also ran into a cost
problem when she tried to get tapes
from the U.S. Army Corps of Engi-
neers about shipping ports. They
quoted her a price of $750 to $1250
to get the tapes.

"As the government puts
more and more information on mag-
netic tape, I'm just afraid the cost is
going to knock out the smaller me-
dia," Martin said.

Lisa Touye' of MICAR con-
tributed to this report.

of jail that he's going to have a drink and he knows
he's going to drive drunk again.

Daily News reporters encountered a number of
roadblocks while working on the series. The first
was the Ohio Department of Motor Vehicles refusal to
give them computer tapes of the state's driver's li-
cense records, and the records of motor vehicle viola-
tion convictions.

The price is right...

"Then they decided they'd sell it to us for an
astronomical price, " said Daily News Staff Writer
Mizzell Stewart. "We finally worked out a deal to get
the tapes for the cost of the tapes themselves-$475."

Then they got the tapes—all 67 of them.

They also found that the records were divided
into two separate databases—one with the key field,
names, addresses and so forth, and the other with all
the conviction information, Stewart said. "It could
take days to run a simple join," he said.

Then the reporters discovered that the DMV
didn't send them all the documentation for the tapes.

"We found a lower-echelon computer guy in the depart-
ment who helped us find out what it all meant," Stewart
said.

Next they approached the local university to see if the
people in computing would be interested in helping out by
downloading the tapes on their mainframe.

"They said they could write the routines and do it, but
they didn't have the time and weren't really interested,"
Stewart said.

After that snub, they talked with Jack Gaines, MIS
director at the Daily News, who said he'd do the work on the
paper's mainframe in his spare time.

Soon after that, Gaines was bringing printouts of his
analyses down to the newsroom twice a week, and Carollo
and Theis followed up on the computer findings.

"Reporters don't have to do the computer analysis for
it to be good. The key is to keep the analysis in-house and
have it done by someone who's trusted," Stewart said.

The mainframe analysis worked so well that now the
paper is connecting the newsroom to the mainframe sot
reporters can access tapes at any time. Two reporters a
editor will be trained to work on the mainframe as well, he
said.
