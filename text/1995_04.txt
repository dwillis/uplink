A newsletter for the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting


Uplink update 

School is in. The education beat is made for computer-as- sisted reporting. In this issue, topjournalists from Florida, New Jersey and Washington, D.C, tell you everything from analyz- ing segregation to SAT scores. These stories underscore how reporters can improve their COV- erage day in and day out by know- ing how to handle electronic in- formation. 

In addition, Dateline NBC's David Hinchman recounts how he battled for data to show how the FAA doesn't tenforce its rules, and how commuter airline safety suffers. 

And we help you keep abreast of what's happening on the Internet, including tips on how to check the federal budget on line.

Use computers for-good education stories The school of hard data 

By Penny Loeb U.S. News & World Report 

If you want to do a computer-as- sisted story about schools, you have hit the jackpot. Probably no other beat offers such a wealth of data at so little cost. Schools and colleges use data to track spend- ing, and meet state and federal report- ing requirements. At U.S. News, we have documented school segregation, inequities in a key federal grant program, and the run- down condition of school buildings. Computerized records were vital to our Dec. 13, 1993 cover story "Sepa- rate and Unequal," documenting how special education programs are segre- gated, rife with misspending, and harm- ing children.

Doing "Separate and Unequal" 

The basic data for "Separate and Unequal" was the survey of racial makeup of schools, done every two years by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights. It encompasses districts with more than 25,000 students, and a random sample of about a third of the smaller districts. The most recent data is for 1992. His- torical data goes back to 1968. 

The survey includes the number of students by race and gender by school. It also has a racial breakdown for those in special education, gifted programs, and those receiving corporal punish- ment. Journalists should get the addi- tional documentation for the survey, which shows what data is missing. There are some major omissions and quirks. 

We supplemented this data with 

state records. Connecticut, for in- stance, includes many more details. 

We used this data to show that black kids are more likely to be in special education than white kids. It also showed that black kids are more likely to be labeled mentally retarded, while white kids get the less stigmatiz- inglabel oflearning disabled. We found tremendous variation in the type of education for these students. Some are included in regular classrooms.

What's affecting test scores? 

By Rick Linsk 

Asbury Park (NJ) Press 

New Jersey encompasses more than 2,000 public high schools, but one factor divides them more than any other: poverty. Nothing else correlated as closely in our school-by-school analysis of test scores. Newspapers from the New York Times to the Philadelphia Inquirer have done similar stories. We took on the task after the state decided it would no longer produce its own yearly "school report card," and lawmakers debated how to meet a court mandate to help poor dis- tricts. 

Getting state data 

The state still collects much of the data for the report cards: test scores, drop-out rates, enrollment,

Data shows lax FAA enforcement 

Finding the toothless tiger 

By David Hinchman Dateline NBC 

The FAA official paused for a long time, especially for prime time television, as hegroped for response. 

Dateline NBC's David Bloom had just told him, "Our research shows that for every $100 that the FAA fines a commuter airline they actually collect $12. That doesn't seem to have much teeth." 

dents, missing rivets and numerous other inci- dents stretched back 10 years. The database revealed a wide array of problems with main- tenance, flight operations and security. 

The moment culminated a long and exhaust- ing data dance with the FAA. 

When we started talking to pilots, we found near unanimity both at the airline and within the industry that Mesa had serious safety prob- lems. We couldn't convince former Mesa man- agers to go on camera. SÃ¨veral Mesa pilots did agree to talk if they were disguised. They told viewers about safety problems and predicted a crash if things didn't change. 

The story started six months earlier, when we decided to probe commuter airline safety. I knew the FAA's Oklahoma City office kept an inspections database, so I asked for it. They seemed cooperative. I didn't need to file a FOIA. After waiting several weeks, I received an in- spections database. 

We used the Mesa story as part of a larger probe of problems in the commuter airline industry. 

But I discovered there was no information on violations or fines. I called Jack Price, the FAA point man in Oklahoma City. He said "Oh, you want to know what they found when they in- spected." I groaned. 

After several more weeks, I received a ver- sion of the Enforcement Information System (EIS) database. It tracks every fine and viola- tion the FAA dishes out, including the proposed fine and final settlement. There was only one problem: many of the names of the carriers were missing. I called Price again. He told me to call someone in Washington. About 50 phone calls later I discovered Jack had left out the "viola- tor" field. 

We covered a lot of ground using standard paper trail reporting, but the databases set the story apart. NASA's Aviation Safety Report- ing System (ASRS) revealed pilots who fell asleep at the controls. The National Transpor- tation Safety Board's investigations database showed every crash during the past 20 years, including several at Mesa. The FAA Service 

Difficulty Report (SDR), showed 13 in-flight engine failures at Mesa during a recent two-year period. 

When I finally got a complete and updated ver- sion of the EIS from Price, I compared the proposed fines with the final settle- ments, and discovered that during the past five years the FAA reduced fines against commuters by 88 percent. 

Where to get the data 

Several months went by. But in the mean- time, I found valuable information in the EIS database. It included case numbers, dates, loca- tions and fines. I used that to send a number of FOIA letters to get the case files of those fined for the biggest amount. The most important information comes from the FAA field office handling a case. 

When the camera rolled, the FAA represen- tative in charge of com- muter airline safety fumbled for a response. After his moment of si- lence, he said, think the FAA does have teeth. We do surveillance. If we find something that shows us that there isn't :full compli- ance with the regulations or company procedures we take action I re- ally can't comment on the terms of the fines that are suggested and what the final settlement 

That wasn't the only time the FAA accused Mesa of flying "unairworthy" planes. Cracks,

I soon found something remarkable about Mesa airlines, the largest independent com- muter in the country. It seemed the airline went nine months using substandard parts in many of its planes. To make sure no one found out, Mesa falsified records. The coverup unravelled when an engine failed in flight, forcing an emergency landing.

Finding nepotism in school districts 

All in the family 

By Scott Anderson 

Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel 

The Broward County school district- the seventh largest in the nation - has spent mil- lions of dollars in questionable personnel prac- tices. It's happening in a system where nearly one in five employees are related thanks to one of the weakest nepotism policies in the state. 

In addition, substantial overtime was paid to employees and high-ranking administrators were retiring with six-digit golden handshakes because of policies that paid off an unlimited amount of unused vacation and sick leave. 

The series ran May 22, 1994. A preview ran May 13 when district officials made policy changes - primarily because they knew we were about to publish a series about the prob- lems. 

We used the school district's nine-track tapes of all personnel information available to the public. This being Florida - blessed with one of the best open records law in the country - 

that translated into virtually everything the school district collected about employees ex- cept their most recent evaluations and medical history. Then we built our own database and did numerous sorts. That included who were the highest paid employees, who had the most vacation and sick leave saved up and a dozen other categories. The most interesting and pro- ductive sort matched everyone who had the same home telephone number, giving us alist of employees (most of whom had the same last name) who were probably related. That gave us the lead on our nepotism story, even though we knew that it did not catch most sibling and parental relationships. 

We've also used computers for other educa- tion stories, including an analysis that found teachers who were teaching subjects they were not certified to teach. The data was obtained from the local school board.

Continued from page one: The school of hard data 

Others spend all day in separate classrooms, which makes them feel inferior. 

We also examined the high cost. Early re- search shows reimbursement formulas often influence the number of children in special edu- cation. 

Chapter One inequities 

The Johnson administration established Chapter One as the cornerstone of federal edu- cation policy. It is supposed to provide money to schools to enhance opportunities for impover- ished students. At $6.2 billion a year, it is now the largest single federal school aid program. 

The money is distributed using a convoluted formula inequity. In the end, schools can use the money as they please. Said one Connecticut official: "Chapter One, that doesn't have anything to do with poverty. It's for read- ing scores." 

The federal government has no central data- base for where Chapter One money goes. So we asked 42 states to supply us with their data. They all complied amazingly fast - within a week. We then hired a temp to input the num- bers, and we check each of the 12,538 entries. We compared the results with three federal databases that show poverty and per pupil spend- ing per district. We found Chapter One money going to schools that were spending as much as $20,000 a student. We found places like Beverly Hills and Scarsdale, N.Y., still get Chapter One funds, though they are wealthy communities with few poor students. 

School segregation 

For the 40th anniversary of Brown V. Board of Education, we looked at school segregation. We profiled the four districts whose cases led to the landmark Supreme Court decision. We did two kinds of analyses. We produced detailed statistics, and looked at the racial makeup for both the school systems and their communities. 

We also looked at school segregation nation- wide, using data that goes back to 1968. Then we followed the methodology of Harvard Uni- versity Professor Gary Orfield, who recently found that schools were becoming more segre- gated for the first time since the 1960s. We measured segregation by the percent of blacks in schools that are more than 50 percent minor- ity. 

Rundown school buildings 

We used three years' worth of the Census Survey of Governments, Education Finance Record, to examine spending for school con- struction. We combined this with racial and poverty data to show that minority inner-city schools spend less than white suburban dis- tricts.

Tracking hospitals that mistreat babies 

Reporters at two major newspapers recently analyzed birth records to probe how hospitals mistreat newborn infants. 

In their December series "Babies at Risk," Cleveland Plain Dealer reporters Dave Davis and Joan Mazzolini used birth records to show that three-quarters of Ohio's 127 community hospitals have been trying to care for sick and extremely premature babies they weren't qualified to treat. 

According to regulators, such babies should be trans- ferred to one of the state's 13 highly sophisticated re- gional medical centers. This was often not happening. According to critics, the blame falls largely on a system where hospitals compete too aggressively for patients. 

Shortly after the series ran, Ohio's top health official called on lawmakers to give him more power to prevent such practices in the future. 

The New York Times 'Dean Baquet and Jane Fritsch, in "Mismanaged Care: how public hospitals fail," compared the city's public and private hospitals when it comes to delivering babies. 

A computer analysis of 1993 city and state birth records produced some dramatic numbers. For babies weighing more than 5.5 pounds - the cutoff doctors use as an indication of good health - the death rate for babies born at the public hospitals was 80 percent more than the rate at the private hospitals. Public hospitals also had higher rates of serious birth injuries. The differences remained significant even after Baquet and Fritsch took into account the differences in the health of mothers at the various hospitals. 

Check Clinton's budget on-line 

The federal budget comes in four cumbersome books or four searchable text files. The choice is yours. 

The 1996 proposed budget and free full-text searching software may be obtained on-line through the U.S. Com- merce Department's STAT-USA information service. The documents are available through STAT-USA's Internet service using file transfer protocol (ftp), gopher and the World Wide Web (www) at the following ad- dresses: 

The ftp site is ftp. stat-usa.gov/pub/budgetfy96 The gopher site is gopher.stat-usa.gov/budgetfy96 The web site is http://www.doc.gov/inquery/ budgetfy96 

At the sites, look first for information about Adobe Acrobat, the software that lets you search the text. The accompanying readme file tell how to load the software in Windows. The budget text files require PKUNZIP, and that's provided, too. 

For more information, call STAT-USA at (202) 482- 1986.
