NURSING HOME ENTRANCE 

Elderly evictions 

By Doug Stanley The Tampa Tribune 

When The Tampa Tribune! broke the news that one of the nation's largest nursing-home chains intended to evict more than 50 of its poorest residents in Tampa, reaction was swift. 

A circuit court judge issued an injunction, state health officials launched an investiga- tion, a powerful state senator called for fines, and the state attorney general's office threat- ened to broaden its ongoing probe into fraud within the Medicaid system. 

But what initially appeared to be a local

story about an isolated incident grew into a six-month Tribune investigation of the qual- ity of care in Florida nursing homes run by large corporations whose stock is traded on Wall Street. 

The seemingly isolated incident wasn't isolated at all. Vencor Inc., the same com- pany evicting residents in Tampa under the guise of a remodeling project, was evicting or planning to evict Medicaid residents in at least 13 other states. Clearly there was something bigger here. But what? Elderly affairs reporter Lindsay Peterson recalled a conversation she had with senior editor Ray Locker only a few weeks earlier. Locker suggested there might be an enter- prise story in all the money Wall Street was pouring into the nursing home industry and companies like Vencor. 

Peterson began calling stock analysts who told her Vencor's stock had been dropping. Investors were worried cuts in Medicare and Medicaid would cut into profits. 

Nagging questions 

Key questions became obvious: Do large, publicly traded nursing-home cor- porations take better or worse care of resi- dents than other home operators? What role, if any, does the pursuit of profit play in the equation? 

The questions begged to be answered. More than one-quarter of Florida's 70,000 nursing-hom residents live in facilities oper- ated by six publicly traded companies: Beverly Enterprises, Genesis Health Ventures, Health Care & Retirement Corp., Integrated Health Services, Mariner Health Group and Vencor Inc. And an industry trend toward consolida- tion suggested that more and more frail eld- erly would become residents of homes where

shareholders also must be served. 

The project began to take shape when it appeared the answers might lie in public documents - particularly nursing home in- spection dara from the Health Care Financ- ing Administration and financial informa- tion from the Securities and Exchange Com- mission. 

Comparison standards 

We acquired the OSCAR database for Florida from HCFA in ASCII on diskettes and imported the data into Access. Then came the requisite cleanup and false starts associated with unfamiliar data. Because our objective was to measure the homes of the six largest public companies against each other and against all other homes, the first step was to ensure accuracy in the field containing ownership information. Often that informa- tion was out of date. We used state and company documents to make revisions where necessary. This step is crucial. 

Ownership changes among some homes owned by the Big Six companies dictated that we look only at one year's inspection data. The universe became 642 nursing homes whose most recent inspections occurred be- tween January 1997 and May 1998. 

We chose to look at total deficiencies as an overall indication of quality. But we were most interested in severe deficiencies that endangered or harmed patients. A field in OSCAR that assigned a letter-code ranking to each deficiency made that easy. 

How to compare the homes? Should com- parisons be based upon numbers of beds or numbers of homes? After careful consider- ation, we settled on comparing deficiency rates based on numbers of homes because of varying bed-occupancy rates and an inspec- tion system that uses the same size sample regardless of home size. Also, comparisons based on numbers of homes would be easier for readers to grasp. 

A "deficiency" is any violation of a nurs- ing home rule or regulation. A total deft- ciency rate and a severe deficiency rate (both per 10 homes) were calculated for each of the Big Six companies; for all other Florida nurs- ing homes: for all other for-profit homes; and for all nonprofit homes. 

What we found 

The Tribune emputeranalysis found that residents of the homes operated by the Big Six companies are about 20 percent more likely to be harmed or put at risk than are residents of all other Florida nursing homes. It also showed that quality of care varied greatly among thebig chains - when compared both to each other and to all other homes. 

Key questions became obvious: Do large, publicly traded nursing- home corporations take better or worse care of residents than other home operators? What role, if any, does the pursuit of profit play in the equation? 

With that key finding in hand - and reams of computer data on the care records of individual homes - Peterson and Tribune medical reporter Vickie Chachere descended on public records repositories around the state gathering the details that would put the flesh on the computer-constructed skeleton. They combed through thousands of pages of paper records, which held the human detail. Hundreds of interviews followed. Countless hours were spent in nursing homes. The SEC's EDGAR database and the companies' own Web sites provided financial context. 

Published as a special 8-page section on Nov. 15, the project struck a chord with readers and with lawmakers. Moderated by executive editor Gil Thelen, a community forum on a weeknight just before the holi- days brought 150 people to the newspaper's downtown offices. State and federal lawmak- ers filed reform bills. Published during the midst of a change in administrations at the state level, the real impact of the project won't be felt until after the legislative session.

ILLNESS MANIPULATION 

Upcoding downfall 

By Dave Davis and Joan Mazzolini The Plain Dealer 

Out in the farmland of Ohio, far from sophisticated 1,000-bed teaching hospitals, hospital administrators say they are caring for the sickest elderly patients. It defied logic, experts told us. They were right. The rural hospitals aren't treating the most serious cases, but they are trying to make it look that way on paper to get higher Medicare reimbursements. 

Using four years of Medicare reimburse- ment data compiled by a private company, we found that in our state for-profit hospitals - without exception small in size and located in suburban or rural areas-received larger Medi- carereimbursements than other hospitals. They claimed more often that their elderly patients suffered from illnesses with complications. 

In Ohio, this defies logic. It means that small hospitals such as 52-bed Knox Commu- nity Hospital in the rich farmland of south- western Ohio are treating sicker patients than the large, teaching hospitals in Cincinnati, Columbus and Cleveland. Health care experts told us that the opposite was true: Big-city hospitals treated the sickest, usually poorest, patients. 

"No one who is sober would dispute that," Frank Sloan, a researcher at Duke University told us. "It's like disputing the Earth is round." 

Complication claims 

But we did come across a few administra- tors - mostly from hospitals owned or man- aged by Quorum Health Group, Ohio's most powerful for-profit player - who argued the illogical. That's not surprising - our analysis of Medicare reimbursements for 1994 through 1997 found that Quorum's hospitals, on aver- age, claimed that 89 percent of their elderly patients suffered from an illness with complica- tions. For large teaching hospitals, the average was 81 percent. 

In Ohio, Quorum's rate of claiming ill- nesses with complications was considerably higher than even the rate of Columbia HCA/ Healthcare Corp., whose deftness in the art of "upcoding," the practice of making patients sicker on paper than they were in the hospital, has caught the attention of federal investigators and was the subject of a revealing and exhaus- tive investigative project by The New York Times. (See Josh Barbanel's cover story in the 

May 1998 issue of Uplink.) 

To understand how this works, you need to understand that Medicare pays hospitals a fixed dollar amount for treating the elderly based on the illness, known as a Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) in Medicare-speak. Some DRGs are related to one another, one being a more complex (and more expensive) case of the other, such as "simple pneumonia" and respiratory infection with complications." Respiratory infection is the higher reimbursed DRG here. Not surprisingly, we found the number of reported respiratory infections on the rise in Ohio. 

Let's now make this more confusing. Each DRG, in addition to being part of a hierarchy of related illnesses, is part of a pair. DRG pairs are the exact same illnesses, but one has compli- cations and the other doesn't, such as "simple pneumonia" and "simple pneumonia with complications." It should come as no surprise that Medicare pays more for treating the latter. 

DRG analysis 

The New York Times investigation centered on true upcoding, where Columbia claimed reimbursement for treating a more complex DRG. Our stories focused on an offshoot of upcoding, where hospitals claimed high rates of treating an illness with complications. Our stories, published in October, took about three weeks to complete and could be easily duplicated in any state in the nation. The analysis included about one million admis- sions in 170 Ohio hospitals. It was pretty simple, really. We found a Louisville, Ky.-based company that combines information from two U.S. Department of Health and Human Services data files - the Medicare Cost Reports and Medicare Provider and Analysis and Review File (MedPar). The company, Data Advantage, (502) 587-9500, sold us the data for about $200. The data file we received contained hospi- tal-level records by DRG. For each DRG, the records showed the number of elderly parients treated, the average amount the hospital was reimbursed and its bed size, among other things. We then examined each of the several hun- dred DRG pairs and calculated how often hospitals claimed their patients suffered an illness with complications rather than without.

By Adam Pitluk NICAR 

School safety officer Dedri Brown, an African-American diabetic, lost a leg to am- putation. Yet it might have been saved if she had been aware of available treatments. Amputation is just one of several fates suf- fered more frequently by black diabetics than white diabetics, a Newsday investigation found. 

Gerald Adams is another example of in- sufficient health care for Blacks in New York: He has been waiting for a kidney transplant for five years-almost twice as long as the average white parient. 

For the past year, reporters from Newsday examined the health care provided to people in their region. The newspaper conducted a behavioral-risk study of more than 2,000 residents of Long Island and Queens to par- allel surveys done at the federal level. At the helm of the investigation was Newsday data specialist and reporter Ford Fessenden, now with The New York Times. 

Initially, Fessenden's story started as an offshoot of a 1996 report card on all of the hospitals in the area. Newsday Associate Managing Editor Rich Galant wanted to know what the numbers had to say about the health issues facing readers. He and projects editor Bob Tiernan sent Fessenden to find out. 

"We found that the health of people in our region was good virtually on everything except heart disease," Fessenden said, "and nobody had ever really told people they had some of the highest heart attack rates in the country. 

Transformed investigation 

It also quickly became clear that health care varied widely among different popula- tions in Queens and Long Island. The study manifested into an issue of who receives better and more effective health care, whites or blacks. Here is what Newsday found: 

Whites get more intensive treatment. They die of coronary heart disease at a lower rate than blacks but are more likely to undergo advanced heart procedures. Whites also have hip replacements at a rate twice as high as blacks, knee replacements at a rate 23 percent higher, and gall-bladder operations at a rate 53 percent higher. (All figures are adjusted for 

differences in age between the races.) 

Blacks receive more radical surgery when less severe alternatives are an option. Newsday cited diabetes as an example: Blacks are more likely to lose feet or legs to amputation; whites are more likely to have surgery to restore blood flow and save their legs. Among 1,907 whites and 385 blacks from Nassau, Suffolk and Queens who had surgery for arteriosclerosis or diabetes-related circulatory problems in 1995, 61 percent of whites had surgery to restore blood flow, but only 43 percent of blacks had s-saving surgery. Dedri Brown was not among them. 
Black women are more likely to have the more invasive kind of hysterectomy treat- ment. Blacks with serious kidney problems wait longer for transplants and are less likely to receive one than whites. For every 1,000 blacks in the hospital with kidney failure, there were 8.2 transplants; for whites, 13.3 transplants. 

Delayed visits 

Fessenden and his team analyzed some 3 million records of hospital admissions in Long Island and Queens covering a period of five years. 

As part of the inquiry, Newsday, joined by The New York Times, sued the state - which had refused to release fields in health care databases identifying doctors and insurance companies - and won. Newsday then showed that the best hospitals and busiest doctors treated white patients almost exclusively. Newsday also commissioned a polister and concluded that blacks are more likely to seek alternatives to traditional medicine and delay visiting a doctor. 

"Even blacks with good insurance are sicker when they arrive at the doors of medi- cal practitioners," he said. "Black cancer suf- ferers are more likely to die of their disease - a strong indicator they aren't getting care early enough." 

Treatment disparities have been an onge- ing problem in medicine, Fessenden said. The purpose of his coverage was to let the numbers tell the story and make patients and doctors alike aware of this dirty little secret. On Feb. 14, 1999, a local conference of health officials addressed the problem, a di-

NURSING HOME ENTRANCE 

Wanted: mentally ill 

By Dawn Fallik NICAR 

Mike Berens' three-part series, "Dangerous Bedfellows," began with the wrong question. "Ihad seen that the cost of health care in jails was going way up, and a tip told me it was mostly psychotropic drugs," said the Chicago Tribune reporter. "So I wanted to find out how many mentally ill patients were in the jails." 

Instead, he found the state taking mentally ill patients off the streets and out of the institu- tions and placing them into nursing homes. The reasoning: The state split the costs of care for nursing home patients with Medicaid. But, if the patient were placed in an institution, the state paid the full cost. 

Using about a dozen federal and state data- bases, including the OSCAR nursing home database, Berens pieced together the skeleton of a dangerous and occasionally deadly prac- tice. He found that nursing home owners openly searched for mentally ill patients and that the Department of Public Aid often turned a blind eye to nursing homes filled with non- elderly residents. 

The series, published Sept. 27-29, 1998, resulted in a federal investigation of Medicaid fraud. The state responded by launching its own investigation. Illinois recently admitted that 17 of its nursing homes were actually being operated as mental institutions; all were then withdrawn from the Medicaid program. 

Because of the series and the investigation that followed, many nursing homes will be re- licensed to allow such patients, but staffs will be required to receive specialized service and reha- bilitation training. 

Violent histories 

Berens found that many of the incoming mentally ill patients had histories of violence and needed intensive psychiatric care and drug therapies, neither of which nursing home em- ployees were trained to handle. 

"In 99 percent of the cases, the attacks-and the resulting injuries - were never reported to police. This lack of reporting is part of a major problem," Berens said. "I documented hun- dreds of incidents of attacks and injury from the state nursing home inspection reports." 

Creating his own database of incidents, Berens found evidence of sexual and physical abuse of elderly patients and neglect of those 

who needed psychiatric care. In one case, he found a man whose behavior goals included keeping sexual fondling of other patients down to three times a week. Department of Public Aid officials denied putting mental patients into nursing homes. In order to subvert a rule that Medicaid would pay only for patients in homes with more than 50 percent actual nursing home clients, psychiat- ric parients were sometimes reported as physi- cally ill. In one case, a woman whom state doctors had verified as mentally ill was re-classified in a nursing home as suffering from "cranial der- matitis," or bad dandruff, Berens said. 

Underlying numbers 

Much of the evidence Berens used in his series came from a Department of Public Health database, which included a patient-by-patient listing of about 1,200 nursing homes. DPH' state twin, the Department of Public Aid, was not so helpful. "I would go to them with the numbers I had, showing that thousands of patients in nursing homes were mentally ill. And they would tell me I didn't understand the num- bers and that I wasn't calculating the figures right," Berens said. "I've never had public officials just out-and-out lie to my face be- fore." Although the federal Medicaid cost report shows the owners of nursing home facilities, it only includes those who own more than five percent. When Berens requested the same informa- tion from state sources, he was denied. After several months of wrangling with attorneys, the state relented. Berens then used the data to track down those owning less than 5 percent of the homes. "The whole thing was like an octopus network," he said. It wasn't until Berens completed his inves- rigative work that he finally stepped foot into the nursing homes themselves. "The thing that helped me most was find- ing real advocares inside who helped guide me through the system. The series was a real melding of computer database technology and old-fashioned reporting."

By Mark J. Rochester 

The Indianapolis Star and The Indianapolis News Too often, daily newspapers are reluctant to pursue major investigative efforts after the so- called "big story" has been published and the problem exposed. But do we really go back and take a second look? 

Sure, we all do follow-up stories: What is the reaction, if any, of the public or govern- ment officials to the findings of the investiga- tion? Will anything likely change as a result of the investigation? Those are important stories, but they may signal the premature end of an investigation. Often, there is much more work to be done. For various reasons - lack of resources, other investigative projects in the pipeline, fear of repetition - we fail to keep digging following an investigation. We miss a lot of good stories when we do that. When state government and health officials promised significant reforms following publi- cation of a year-long investigation of nursing home care printed in June, it was tempting for The Indianapolis Star and The Indianapolis News to simply bundle up our documents, source lists and computer databases and move on to the next project. 

Past and present 

The newspapers had documented the per- vasiveness of poor care in nursing homes and the shortcomings of numerous state and fed- eral regulations that allowed the problems to linger. State and federal authorities reacted swiftly: State officials announced a series of reform initiatives, including tougher penalties against the worst providers. 

We could have assigned a reporter to follow those reforms and considered our work done on the issue, but we knew there was more to the story. Stick with an investigation until you've exhausted all crucial subject areas. 

The reporters had uncovered numerous leads and tips during the initial reporting ef- fort. Others came flooding in after publication of the series, "The Tarnished Years." After several meetings, we decided to take the ex- craordinary step of undertaking another six- month investigation. Instead of reducing the staffers dedicated to the effort, the newspapers 

expanded the reporting team to three report- ers, who, along with the CAR coordinator and a dedicared photographer, tackled an entirely new set of questions about the quality of care in nursing homes. 

Among the key findings of the second investigation: 

As the need for reform was being debated by state health and government officials, prob- lems in nursing homes rose dramarically from 

For various reasons - lack of resources, other investigative projects in the pipeline, fear of repetition - we fail to keep digging following an investigation. We miss a lot of good stories when we do that. 

the previous year - there were 50 percent more health and safety violations, a computer analy- sis of state inspection records showed. 

In Indianapolis, residents in predomi- nantly black nursing homes received far worse care than those in white facilities. Among the disparities: Homes serving low-income blacks had nearly five times as many harm-level viola- tions as homes serving whites. 
Needless deaths and illnesses occur in nursing homes every year because of problems associated with the routine feeding and care of patients. 

Separate and unequal 

Aside from the significant increase in health and safery violations, the most striking element of the latest investigation were the racial dis- parities in quality of care. Tackling that issue was difficult. 

Our first arrempt to obtain data containing demographicinformarion about nursing homes from was blocked by government officials, who denied our FOIA requests. Rather than continue that fight, however, we decided to pursue the matter at the state level, a strategy

tems subject to state and federal regulation. We made FOIA requests to all 50 states and the federal government. We spent hundreds of hours compiling, standardizing and scru- tinizing data. Our analysis was so thorough and unassailable that the U.S. Environmen- tal Protection Agency inquired about hiring our database editor, Barbara Hansen. 

Matters of "significance" 

Some of our findings: 

About 40,000 water systems violate safe drinking water laws each year; 9,500 of them have "significant" problems that pose "seri- ous threats to public health," according to the EPA. Yet just one in 10 "significant" violators face binding enforcement action such as an administrative order, fine or law- suit. One-quarter of all "significant" viola- tors have been in that category for at least three years. 
Eleven states have not implemented all the Safe Drinking Water Act's contamina- tion limits, which should have been in place by 1995. At least 13 states don't meet federal guidelines by inspecting water systems every three to five years. A half-dozen have not given their drinking water regulators the power to levy fines. 

The EPA is more than a year behind in completing required assessments of drink- ing water programs in at least 11 states. What's more, the agency's Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS), the main national database used to monitor water systems' performance, is terribly in- accurate. 

The stories got a strong response. We met requests for more than 30,000 reprints. In Congress, the project prompted an inquiry to the EPA by Reps. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio. Waxman's office says he intends to raise the issue with EPA officials at hearings this year. 

A path full of hurdles 

The project began simply, but it didn't stay that way. First, we went about learning how drinking water rules work. Then we set measures for evaluating their success: Are states implementing required regulations? Are states conducting regular sanitary surveys (inspections) of water systems? Are state and 

federal officials taking action against systems that violate health and safety rules? 

We sent FOIA requests to the EPA and the states for the records we needed. The states' data were wildly inconsistent - each state has different rules on what constitutes a violation of drinking water laws and what warrants an enforcement acti√≥n. 

More troublesome: the states' data didn't jibe with much of what the EPA had in SDWIS. The federal database was riddled with errors. Some we were able to resolve, but we had to adjust our expectations. We used SDWIS to draw conclusions at the state and national levels, but information on specific water systems had to be verified indepen- dently. 

We finished with four databases: SDWIS, which we imported into Paradox using Mon- arch parsing software, and three we built ourselves. The first, based on sanitary survey records, allowed us to calculate average in- spection rates for water systems in each state. The second, based on census data and infor- mation from EPA's infrastructure needs sur- vey, allowed us to calculate per-capita costs for bringing water systems into compliance with federal requirements. The third, based on state budget data, allowed us to determine each state's per-capita spending on drinking water oversight. 

Lessons learned 

Know the rules: You can't interpret data without a keen understanding of how it was compiled and categorized. Plus, you'll win over sources with your technical expertise. 
Check data: To confirm findings' valid- ity, develop alternate queries and different approaches that should yield the same result. 
Be honest: Explain your data's limits. We wrote a separate story on the problems we found - especially with SDWIS - to help readers understand what conclusions could and could not be reached. 
Allow time: When you re getting data from varied sources, budget time for cleanup and verification. Also, many states aren't used to handling requests for computerized records, so there's a lot of haggling.

Next, we grouped hospitals together based on their size (small, medium and large) and who operates them (for-profits or non-profits). 

We found that size mattered little in how often hospitals claimed complications. Own- ership, however, was a big deal. Because the records included the average amount hospitals received for each DRG, we also estimated how 

much tax money would have been saved if the small, for-profit hospitals had received reim- bursement for patients no sicker than patients in their urban, non-profit counterparts. The figure was a whopping $22 million for the four-year period. Dave Davis can be reached by e-mail at ddavis@plaind.com

From page six: Measured neglect 

that had worked well while putting together our original series. 

We knew the state of Indiana collected the same nursing home census information as the federal government, SO we hoped it would be simple matter of obtaining that database. It wasn't. State officials denied the existence of any such electronic records, claiming only hard copy forms tucked into thousands of files warehoused in their offices. 

Even though we were running into road- blocks set up by officialdom, we had other successes that inspired us to keep going. Using Paradox and SPSS software to analyze several different databases we had already obtained, we determined other patterns in the data that let us know we were on the right track. For example, we documented the impact poverty has on quality of care by examining state inspection records, U.S. census data and Med- icaid reimbursement rates from the govern- ment. Analysis showed that most poorly per- forming facilities were in low-income neigh- borhoods and had high numbers of low-in- come residents - making us all the more anx- ious to look at racial demographic data. 

Forced entry 

To get it, we'd have to roll up our sleeves and do it the old-fashioned way. 

Armed only with a Toshibalaptop, wewent to Indiana's health department and had them pull hundreds of individual files on nursing homes. We then entered the racial data on residents and employees in a Paradox dbffile, 

The analysis of that data yielded pages of disparities between care in predominantly black facilities and white ones. In fact, in every measurable way, the black homes were worse by wide margins. 

The reporting that followed produced more action within the ranks of state government. The state health department, grilled by a com- mittee of state legislators about what it in- tended to do about problem nursing homes, has commissioned its own study of racial dis- parities in nursing homes. Other legislators have vowed to hold public hearings regarding the problem.

HANDOUT OF THE MONTH 

Deconstruct discharges 

This handout, #643 in the Resource Center, was provided at NashCAR in 1997 by Robert Benincasa of the Burlington Free Press, Rick Linsk of the Asbury Park Press, and Tom Gaumer of The Plain Dealer 

What hospital discharge records are: A documentation of each hospital discharge, showing the patient's illness, surgical proce- dures, age, insurance type, town or ZIP code, discharge status and other information. They're known generally as Uniform Billing (UB) records. Check with your state govern- ment or call the National Association of Health Data Organizations at (703) 532- 3282 to ask about availability. What hospital discharge records are not: They won't capture patients who visit the emergency room without being admitted. They won't capture surgeries or other proce- dures done in outpatient settings. They aren't "severity adjusted." Some hospitals have sicker patients than others. To compare them, you must control for "case- mix" differences. Some papers have done so with SPSS; others have hired consultants. They're not perfect. Some hospitals code the same thing differently; some leave certain fields blank. Check with your hospitals. See if there's an effort in your area to code data consistently. They don't have confidential information about patients. Patient and doctor names are probably deleted. Dates may be deleted as well. Unless you have a unique patient identi- fier, they won't provide an unduplicated count of people who have a particular condi- tion - some people are admitted more than once for the same thing. Still, you can count episodes such as heart attacks, gunshots, births, hysterectomies and so on. 

Fields and yields 

Field: Diagnostic-related group (DRG) Yield: Very specific information on the illness, accident or criminal episode that re- sulted in a hospital admission. The starting point for answering many types of questions. Field: Diagnosis (or DX) codes and pro- cedure codes 

Yield: Specific aspects of a particular case. Also where you Il find the codes for accidents and crime. The various codes can be found in the ICD-9 manual, or International Classifi- 

cation of Diseases. Visit the Public Use Files area of HCFA's Web site at http:// www.hefa.gov/stats/pufiles. htm for an expla- nation of the codes. Also check the Web site of the National Center for Health Statistics at http://wwww.cdc.gov/nchswww/productsl products.htm For a hard copy, contact St. Anthony's Press at (800) 632-0123 Field: Length of stay (LOS), or days in the hospital Yield: Hospitalization patterns by insurer. or hospital, which may be driven by finances and market forces. Among hospitals with similarly severe case mixes, can provide some evidence of the influence of managed care. The trend is to control costs by shifting care from the hospital to other settings, such as home or a rehabilitation center. One increas- ingly viable frontier for analysis is outpatient surgery data. Field: Payer Yield: Could show dominance of a par- ticular HMO in a particular market or char- acterize the extent to which consumers have a choice of providers. When cross-tabulated with DRGs, indicates patterns of illness in Medicaid and Medicare populations. A win- dow into larger social and economic prob- lems and policy questions. Field: Billing amount Yield: Comparing hospital rates, though keep in mind there is a variety of reasons why charges will differ, including Medicare burden, teaching mission and patient mix. Also, billed charges don't reflect discount agreements with insurers and rarely equate to the amount of money the hospital is actually paid. Field: Home of patient (ZIP code or town) Yield: Can demonstrate regional pull of a particular hospital for a particular procedure or illness. Potentially useful for characteriz- ing competitive aspects of the health care market, such as mergers. Can show regional patterns of illness or social problems that result in hospital admission, such as violent crime, domestic abuse or teen pregnancy.

By Richard Mullins NICAR 

There are two tips this month: one origi- nal, one stolen. We try to run an honest column here, so I'll tell you which is which. I stole the first tip from Tom McGinry, the new NICAR trainer. Do me a favor and return it to him after you use it. 

Questioning integrity 

The problem was a basic one: a data integ- rity check during processing at NICAR. Spe- cifically, we wanted to know exactly how many data lines were in the text file that came off a tape cartridge. A question had arisen about whether the tape download was com- plece, so we needed a line count. 

Many data files are too big to open in a text editor. Even if they' not, the process can be slow and unwieldy. There may not be a line counter in the editor you are using. 

Here is what McGinty did. (It's so perfect, so simple, I wish I'd thought ofit.) He created a FoxPro table with one field of just two characters. He did the append command and waited for FoxPro to finish. The resulting record count for the table was an accurate line count for the text file. Plus, it was efficient. Because there were fewer characters to im- port, the process was faster and didn't waste temporary disk space. 

" 

date/times can be stored in one field. An example would be one field for both the start time and the date for a cell phone call or an emergency dispatch, then another field for the time and date the call ended or the police or ambulance arrived. This makes it easy to calculate the duration of a call or the response time, especially for events that start before midnight and end afterward. 

But what if you just want the time or date element plucked out of a date/time field? I once used the Access functions DateSerial() and TimeSerial() to do this. It works, but the syntax requires a bit of typing. The main utility of these functions is updating a date field by 30 days from the current value, or for one year from today, and the like. 

Here's why this worked. If you have a text data file that is 1,500 characters long and import it into a table whose specified fields only accommodate the first 50 characters, then Fox Pro skips the rest of the line and goes to the next line. 

Splitting dates and times 

It's simpler, however, to use the functions Date Value() and TimeValue(). Here are some query examples based on a table of parking or traffic tickets, with a field called TicketDateTime. 

The next tip has to do with date/time values in Access. It's a handy feature that 

How many tickets written on each date? SELECT DateValue (TicketDateTime), count TicketDateTime) FROM Tickets GROUP BY DateValue TicketDateTime) How many tickets were written in the afternoon? SELECT FROM Tickets WHERE TimeValue (TicketDateTime) >= #1:00 PM#

(1) Use mathematics as a short-hand language, rather than as an engine of inquiry. 
(2) Keep to them till you have done,

FIRST VENTURES 

Note to self: Double-check 

By Eric Mansfield WKYC - Cleveland 

My first journalism teacher, Annette Tay- lor, used to tell me in class to check my facts once and check my numbers twice. Thank God I remembered that on a recent story on professional solicitors who keep more than their fair share of the money they collect for charities. 

I felt good about my skills, having read Brant Houston's Computer-Assisted Reporting 

On the day of the story, I swear I heard (my first journalism teacher) telling me to check those numbers one more time Guess what? It was a typo My "smoking gun" never fired. 

- A Practical Guide and being self-taught in Access with the help of daily tips on the IRE and NICAR mailing lists. 

Donating to solicitors 

I obtained a database from the state attor- ney general's office detailing the solicitation campaigns for 492 Ohio charities. In all but 27 cases, the solicitors kept at least 70 percent of the donated money. 

I came across an eye-popper. According to the database, the group that solicited for "Po- lice and Fire Retirees of Ohio" collected $10.3 million and gave the charity only $1.2 million. In other words, they were keeping about nine million bucks to cover their costs. Nine mil- lion! 

I thought: "This is it! This is my smoking gun!" 

Actually, it wasn't that wild of a figure many of the solicitors in the database were keeping hundreds of thousands of dollars for their "operating costs." So, seeing $9 million really wasn't as outrageous as seeing, for ex- ample, a database of teacher salaries in which 

one English teacher made $1 million. In other words, it wasn't an obvious typo. 

Stop the promos! 

We knocked on the front door of the aban- doned house that was listed as the address for the solicitor. I finally reached the solicitor's CEO by phone, and he begged me not to run the story. He claimed the numbers were false. Having confronted many people who try to lie their way out of a tough spot, I assumed he was just covering his hide. 

Our promotions department had already done one of those deep, dark "scamming the charities" spots using shots of the abandoned house and claiming the solicitor had made a quick getaway. 

On the day of the story, I swear I heard Annette Taylor telling me to check those numbers one more time. I called the attorney general's office and had them re-check their database. 

Guess what? It was a typo. All of the other numbers checked out, so I could still spotlight a solicitor keeping thousands. But my "smok- ing gun" never fired. 

Lawsuit dodged 

My gut told me all along that the CEO was lying. Fortunately, less than an hour from air time, I managed to stop the first promo from running - and I saved the station and my name from a big lawsuit. 

After completing two small CAR investiga- tions earlier, it was easy to get overconfident. Using criminal databases, Ihad detailed a failed employment system in both the Akron public schools and the city of Akron. Both systems conducted background checks for new hires but lacked any structure for keeping track of employ- ees once they were hired. We found employees using their vacation time to serve sentences for crimes committed after they were hired. 

The story on the solicitors was still a success. Anytime someone is keeping too much of the money intended for the less fortunate, you can run a provoking story. And, I've still got a few nuggets for follow-up stuff.

LOCAL AND FEDERAL DATA 

It might seem obvious to say it, but com- puter use for daily reporting and other forms of newsgathering continues to grow. Research over the past five years has traced a steady pattern of increased use for daily stories and special projects. 

Almost 90 percent of newspapers used com- puters in newsgathering and 97 percent used online services in newsgathering in 1998. The discrepancy may lie in the fact that some respondents perceived online use as different from computer use, which, to them, meant use of offline databases. 

The research is based on national mail censuses with a longitudinal design conducted through the Computer-Assisted Reporting Research Project at the University of Miami. Each spring since 1994, self-administered ques- tionnaires were mailed to papers with Sunday circulations of 20,000 or more. 

Furthermore, there is growth in the num- ber of responding newspapers that have their own Web sites. In 1998, almost 83 percent of newspapers had online editions - up from 67 percent a year earlier. 

CALL FHEDATABASE 

Frequency measures 

Data in Table 1 show that more than 92 percent of 1998 respondents use the Internet in newsgathering - steady growth since 1994 when it was used by only one in four news- rooms.

Commercial services that acquire public and private databases and package them for sale are also widely used by American journalists. Lexis/Nexis, a vast collection of libraries of public records and publication archives data- bases, is the leading commercial resource, used by 36 percent of responding newsrooms. Its use has jumped noticeably in the past year. America Online, once the leading commercial online resource, declined slightly. 

Local government information is also widely used and widely available. Not every local government has made its records available on the Web, but the proportion is increasing annually and will likely continue to grow.

Table 2 shows that news researchers, who once did almost all of the online research at the beginning of this decade, take on a significantly different role as the decade ends. As online research has become more user-friendly and accessible, these individuals have become train- ers or coaches for others in the newsroom. As a result, an increasing proportion of reporters and editors, the data show, are doing their own research when possible. 

Table 3 shows that the frequency of using online resources has increased steadily over the five-year period. Daily use of online tools has grown from about one-quarter of newsrooms to nearly two-thirds in 1998. Similarly, the number of newsrooms that have never used online tools has almost disappeared. 

Search engine selection 

Journalists tend to use two search tools. Alta Vista, one of the original search engines on the Web, and Yahoo!, a search index, are the choices of nearly two-thirds of respondents. 

FORMAT, NICAR CAN NOW PROCESS IT. 

Search engines are selected for a wide range of reasons. The most commonly cited reason, in response to an open-ended question, was that one-quarter of users started with what they considered a "major search engine." Other Continued on page thirteen

reasons were familiarity with the engine, the type of search site selected, a "hit or miss" approach, choice based on the type of informa- tion needed, whatever search engine was the default site, the recommendation of an expert, convenience, speed and whether it was bookmarked. 

Most users did take advantage of the ad- vanced search options available. About 75 per- cent of respondents used advanced tools at some level, while only 17 percent reported not using them or did not know if they used them. 

Web site pros and cons 

The attraction of information on the Web lies in its large number of state and federal government sites. State sites, in general, and one particular federal site, the U.S. Census, were the most commonly used sites. One in four journalists reported that their news orga- nizations used these sites. 

Use of newspaper archive and online news- paper sites and a person-finding site, Switch- board, was also common. 

Journalists tend to view the quality of Web sites the same way that they view human sources or hard-copy documents. There is con- cern for the quality of information found on Web sites. To be considered a journalistically strong Web site, respondents cited reputable sources most often (81 percent), but validity and accuracy (78 percent) were also viewed as importantcharacteristics. More than two-thirds of journalists want searchable sites with ease of access and speed. Similarly, weak Web sites 

contained inaccurate information, useless or bad content, bad links and no attribution. Lack of verification (54 percent), unreliable information (45 percent), lack of site credibil- ity (44 percent), bad sourcing (44 percent), difficulty in finding a site (24 percent) and truthfulness (18 percent) are the most cited problems for using Web sites. With Web expansion, journalists have nu- merous opportunities to communicate with sources and gather information in new ways. Electronic mail (90 percent) dominates use of non-Web Internet tools. After e-mail, Internet use drops off. File transfer protocol is used by about half of respondents (51 percent) and bulletin board systems are used by about one- quarter (28 percent). Audio conferencing, au- dio streaming, Internet telephony, push tech- nology and video conferencing, in contrast, have yet to be adopted in newsrooms for newsgathering. Finding information is the success story of online resources in newsrooms. It is used for backgrounding for stories (15 percent) and for locating difficult-to-find information (9 per- cent). Journalists believe extending govern- ment coverage and finding sources are other online successes. On the other hand, not taking advantage of online potential is mentioned most often (30 percent). Lack of access (15 percent) and slow learning of online tools are also causes of frustration in newsrooms. Bruce Garrison can be reached at (305) 284-2846 or by e-mail at bruce@miami.edu

Sniffing out the perfect data to use in your health care stories alone can be enough to cause carpal tunnel syndrome. The sheer volume of data out there can also cause a bad case of ICD- 9 code 780.4. (You'll have to look that one up.) Still, there is a lot of very useful data to be found. While not nearly comprehensive, this list will hopefully reduce your time searching. The health care sleuth should keep in mind that quite a bit of the information on the Web is in the form of reports and journal articles. Also remember that government sites often use Adobe Acrobat file (*.pdf) formar, so installing Adobe Reader, which is free, will prove ex- tremely useful. 

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 

Probably the first logical stop on any search for medical data is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (http:// www.cdc.gov). This monster site deserves ex- tensive explanation, but to thoroughly cata- log all the data available would take up vol- umes. It's a fairly easy site to navigate, so your best bet is to dig around and familiarize yourself with all that's available. 

One of the most useful areas within the CDC site is WONDER (http:// wonder.cdc.gov). Registering offers users the opportunity to save work in progress and access "members only" data. With WON- DER you can: 

Search for the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report articles; 
Query the CDC's extensive collection of data sets, which document mortality, cancer incidence, hospital discharges and AIDS; 
Find contact information for CDC staff members, other health professionals, or other Wonder users; and 

Send e-mails of most search results ei- ther in HTML or ASCII format for easy portability into database programs. 

One recent addition to the CD Csite is the searchable ICD-9 codes. Click on "Get Info" and select the ICD Finder, something finally making sense of these often confusing Inter- national Classification of Disease numbers. Unfortunately, you can only search by key- word, not by ICD number. 

National Center for Health Statistics 

National Center for Health Statistics (http://www.cdc.gov/nchswww/default.htm) 

The NCHS is the nation's principal health statistics agency and a good place to start your search. Follow the link to the Data Ware- house where there are links to an abundance of information, including downloadable ICD-9 conversion tables, downloadable sta- tistics for Health People 2000 and more. 

National Institutes of Health 

Another must-see site is that of the Na- tional Institutes of Health page for Health Information (http://www.nih.gov/health), which has links to the following: 

National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements (http://odp.od.nih.gov/ ods/), which includes a link to the new Inter- national Bibliographic Information on Di- etary Supplements (IBIDS) database. 

Dietary Supplements seem to be the focus of a lot of media attention these days, and now the NIH has opened a huge Web site dedicated to available research on the effec- tiveness of these popular supplements. Its intuitive interface allows users to enter a dietary supplement into the search engine. 

National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (http:// altmed ad.nih.gov/nccam), which provides information on unconventional health care practices and disseminates research findings. 
Cancer information is available from the National Cancer Institute (http:// www.nci.nih.gov/). For easy access to all clini- cal trials information from the NCI, click on the Cancer Trials link, which will provide information for health professionals, patients and the public concerning cancer treatment, screening, prevention, supportive care, and clinical trials. 
The "Search Databases" link on the Web site of the National Library of Medicine's MEDLINEplus (http:// www.ntm.nih.gov/medlineplust) provides links to AIDS databases, cancer databases and literally tens of others.

Health and Human Services 

The direct link to research and data of the Department of Health and Human Services (http://www.os.dhls.gov).gov) is located at http:// wwww.hhs.gov/policy/research.html. There you'll find links to several of the databases already mentioned as well as the following: National Center for Toxicological Research Gopher; Molecular Biology Databases; Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Pro- gram; and the Health Care Financing Ad- ministration. 

HHS also developed and maintains a Healthfinder site (http://www.health finder.gov/) Clicking on the database sec- tion under "More Tools" links you to an exhaustive listing of health-related sites. You will also find specific information on "Hot Topics" such as AIDS, cancer, child care, diabetes, food safety, Medicare and tobacco. 

Other important sites

Jump to the InteliHealth Profes- sional Network (http://ipn.intelihealth.com! ipns) using the logo in the top right corner of the homepage. There are links to clinical databases, including MEDLINE (among the largest biomedical databases with more than 9,000,000 references to journal articles in all fields of medicine and related disciplines), as well as government and research databases. Also included is a link to MedCite, an ad- vanced medical literature service. 

See the "Health Care" link on Public 

Agenda's Web site (http://www.public agenda.org/) Mostinteresting is the "Story Angles" link, which gives ideas for stories, facts and perspectives. The "Sources and Resources" link offers just what it adver- tises. The "Notable and Newsworthy" link also presents a useful collection of recent articles on health care. Not a lot of hard data, but the site might get those creative juices flowing. 

Despite the humorous name, the Internet Grateful Med (http://igm.nlm.nih.gov) site is dead serious about providing data through links to the following health-related data- bases: MEDLINE (biomedical journals since 1966), AIDSLINE (references to recentAIDS literature), AIDSDRUGS (description ofsub- stances used in AIDS-related trials), AIDSTRIALS (AIDS-related clinical trials), BIOETHICSLINE (references to bioethics literature), ChemID (directory of chemical compounds), DIRLINE (directory of orga- nizations), HealthSTAR (health services and technology assessment research), HISTLINE (literature about history of health-related professions), HSRPROJ (project records for research in progress), OLDMEDLINE (bio- medical journals from 1960 to 1965), POPLINE (references to population, family planning and developing-country issues), SPACELINE (research from space life sci- ences), and TOXLINE (references to toxi- cology information). 

The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (http://www.meps.ahcpr.gov/data.htm) is a rep- resentative national survey of health care use, expenditures, payment sources and in- surance coverage for the U.S. It is also a national survey of nursing homes and their residents. 

At the Web site for the Health Care Financing Administration (http:// www.hcfa.gov), which administers the Medi- care, Medicaid and Child Health federal insurance programs, you'll find national health expenditure tables, projections, Medi- care enrollment statistics, trends by state and county, Medicare utilization statistics, and more. It's a well-designed, easy-to-use site loaded with information.
