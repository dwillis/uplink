KIDS AND VIOLENCE 

# Behind school walls 

## By John Kelly 

The Associated Press, Indianapolis 

Newspaper headlines and nightly news teasers delivered the good word: fewer kids were caught bringing guns into America's schools. 

The news stories cited a federal survey of the states, which reported a drop in gun-re- lated expulsions during the 1997-1998 school year. 

The timing was bizarre for me in India- napolis. 

For months, I had been eyeballing a simi- lar school discipline database I knew the In- 

## CRIME AND COURTS Conviction rate 

By Bill Wallace 

San Francisco Chronicle 

More than a year ago, a source in the San Francisco District Attorney's office told me the city's new DA, Terence Hallinan, was plea-bargaining criminal cases at a dis- turbing pace, and many serious criminal charges were being dismissed in the pro- cess. 

The tip was intriguing, but I needed to find some way of checking it out short of simply examining every case Hallinan's of- fice had handled - a daunting task given the thousands of cases filed annually. 

Late last year, I discovered a type of data called Offender Based Transaction Statis- tics (OBTS) that was used by the Califor- nia Attorney General's office to generate a section of the state's annual report, "Crime and Delinquency in California." The in- formation is known as "Adult Felony Ar- rest Dispositions," available from the Criminal Justice Statistics Center of the state Department of Justice. 

diana Department of Education was com- piling. Just days before the national report came out, I finally got the disk with the In- diana schools' data. 

One dataset listed every expulsion at ev- ery public school along with fields showing the student's grade, gender, date of birth and the reason for expulsion. Another tallied the number of suspensions by reason for each school. 

We were going to be able to do exactly what I had hoped: provide parents with a school-by-school accounting of the discipline happening behind the local schoolhouse walls. 

Within days, we gleaned from the data- base how many students were kicked out of each public school for bringing a handgun to campus, using drugs, alcohol or tobacco or just acting out. Then, we went to work reporting. 

The data was easy to confirm and hard for school officials to dismiss. That's because it comes straight from the local principals' offices. 

## Annual reports 

Each school year, every public school in Indiana must file paper reports with the In- diana Department of Education document- ing their disciplinary actions-some of which is tallied for an annual report the states must submit to the U.S. Department of Educa- tion under the Gun-Free Schools Act. 

The paper reports are certainly public records. Better yet, Indiana keys the infor- mation into a database. Other states prob- ably do the same. 

In our analysis and reporting, we found some weaknesses in the data. First, the tallies for each school only showed how many times students got caught and punished for bring-

ing guns to school or breaking other rules. 

There is no way to know how often of- fenses actually occurred on campus. Some schools may crack down on certain offenses while others turn a blind eye. 

Second, like most crime data, you are going to find inconsistencies when you ask hundreds of school officials to lump incidents into broad categories based on vague defini- tions. 

In Indiana, for example, one school con- fiscated what looked like a grenade from a student and promptly expelled him, state officials said. The grenade turned out to be a cigarette lighter, but the school reported the expulsion to the state under the category of "other firearms." 

## Beyond data 

We overcame those weaknesses with re- porting. We talked to state and local educa- tors, students and others. We also carefully studied the paper reports that schools filed and the instructions they were given in fill- ing out those forms. 

As with most CAR stories, there was more traditional reporting involved here than number-crunching. The whole project took less than a week from the day I popped the floppy disk into my computer. 

All offered insight that helped us explain what conclusions people could and could not draw from the figures. Interviews with school principals gave us added opportunities to check our data against the paper reports they had filed with the state. We checked many schools' figures against individual reports provided by the state. 

Along with our stories, we filed charts list- ing the expulsions and suspensions at every public school in Indiana for various offenses. That allowed local newspapers and broad- casters to do their own stories. 

We filed the package within days of the federal report's release and just as Hoosier children were headed back to school. 

## Under-reporting 

Along the way, we uncovered a prob- lem with the national report: it was at least partly wrong. Indiana had reported 62 gun-related expulsions to the feds. But our database included 129 gun-related expul- sions. 

We rechecked our database work, and I called the state Department of Education official in charge of collecting and reporting this data and asked why the totals were dif- ferent. He called back to say the state totals were right and the ones in the federal report were wrong. 

We continued working on our stories, while the state education staff met to figure out what went wrong. The official called back to say the state had under-reported their fig- ures and said, "We just have to own up to this one." 

Education officials in other states re- ported discrepancies in gun expulsion fig- ures too, and the AP moved a national story highlighting the national report's errors. 

As with most CAR stories, there was more traditional reporting involved here than num- ber-crunching. The whole project took less than a week from the day I popped the floppy disk into my computer. 

We got the data for free, but Indiana's education department is accustomed to fork- ing over large databases to us for nothing. Once we had the database, the computer work was no more sophisticated than import- ing a text file into Microsoft Access and run- ning a half dozen sum and count queries. 

Reporters in other states, which collect and compile the same data from local schools, could easily replicate the reporting.

# Columbine aftermath 

## By Scott Smallwood 

Albuquerque Journal 

A few days after the Columbine High School (Colo.) shooting last April, we asked our local school district for statistics about violence at individual schools around Albu- querque. At first, we were planning to turn around a simple daily, but the district's foot- dragging eventually prompted us to turn the story into a small project. 

Officials first told us that the district had never tallied any of its crime and violence data by school. They said they didn't want to embarrass principals of the more crime-rid- den schools. Instead, each year the district sends the state a general report listing the total number of assaults, gun violations, drug charges and incidents of vandalism. We were welcome to that, they said. 

We imagined that in Albuquerque Public Schools, a district of 120 schools with 85,000 students, district-wide numbers probably told just a small part of the story. We asked the district for its database of criminal reports. (The district has its own police force that patrols the elementary schools and middle schools. City police monitor the high schools.) They wouldn't give it to us electroni- cally and our state law seemed to support them on that. 

## Starting from paper 

They did give us paper printouts of three years of data, which we were able to scan in. Using a fax server that's generally used to scan classified ads and death notices, we were able to quickly scan dozens of pages at one time. Luckily, the paper reports were very clean and a couple of Excel macros later, we had recre- ated their database. 

We then went to the city police to get records of every criminal report filed at the city's 11 high schools for the same time pe- riod. We were the first to combine the two data sets - a total of 13,000 criminal reports over three years - to get a more complete picture of crime in city schools. 

While district officials knew of most gun violations in the schools and correctly re- ported those to the state, they didn't have any record of most of the city police reports, for everything from aggravated assault to rape. 

We found that the district's annual reports underestimated nearly every category, espe- cially assaults and drug violations. We also found, to no surprise, that in a district with 11 high schools and about 30 middle schools, reports of crime and violence weren't spread evenly across the city. Some schools reported four or five times the number of incidents as others. 

The superintendent acknowledged that principals and parents should have this in- formation broken down by school site. 

## Afterthoughts 

There were a number of things we prob- ably should have done differently. 

We didn't realize going in that the underreporting would be such a large part of the story. We should have gone back to the city and requested reports for the three years from the 79 elementary schools and 30 or so middle schools, but by that time we were well into the project and wanted to get it into the paper. Thus, we focused mostly on high schools. 

Also, we probably should have fought longer on getting the data electronically, de- spite the poorly worded state law. 

We found that the district's annual reports underestimated nearly every category, especially assaults and drug violations. 

The stories appeared in the paper a month after we first asked for the violence statistics. About two weeks were wasted negotiating with the district about the data. Once we had created the database, we spent a few days using Access and Excel to analyze the data and another week reporting and writing the stories. We combined the crime data with other school data in our files, including drop- 

A few of the stories on school violence at the IRE Resource Center: 

After the string of multiple school shootings in the early and mid '90s, Education Week reporter Jessica Portner examined easy access to firearms as one of the main causes in explaining why one student killed another on the steps of a Savannah, Ga., school (File 14853). 

Jeff Meader, an Education Week journalist, reported in November 1998 that "during the months that Americans were transfixed by the tales of students killing other students, there were nearly as many stories - if not more - of children setting fire to their schools." (File 4883).

# Inconsistent data

## By Maryjo Sylwester 

IRE and NICAR staff 

Reporters across the country who have looked at school violence statistics say there is one big problem with the data: inconsistent reporting. 

In Raleigh, N.C., WRAL-TV reporter Stuart Watson found cases of sexual harassment reported as sexual assault and bullets reported as guns. 

In Virginia, the state's first-ever "report card" had numbers that seemed to defy reality for three school districts of roughly the same size, according to Jeff South, a journalism profes- sor at Virginia Commonwealth University. Here's what the state said: City of Richmond, 188 reported incidents; Henrico County, a suburb, 859 incidents; and Chesterfield County, a suburb, 11 incidents. 

The Richmond Times Dispatch published ar- ticles at the beginning of April telling the public about the discrepancies in the data. 

"Educators have cautioned that some of the particularly those that record incidents of violence - are subject to the interpretation of the schools reporting them and may not be reli- able as points of comparison from school to school and division to division," one of the Times Dis- patch articles said. 

So how do you overcome this problem? Several reporters from around the country - both print and broadcast chimed in with some suggestions, based on their own experiences. What follows is an overview of what they had to say. 

The first step is to study the data, looking for "numbers that seem to defy reality," and ask for written guidelines on how school officials defined or categorized violent incidents, South recom- mended. 

Watson suggested running an internal check by comparing school data against alternative sources such as police logs or reports and other school reports. Even if the school has its own po- lice force, city police or sheriff's deputies may also take reports of criminal activity at schools. 

Be sure to ask data collection or analysis people to explain any discrepancies and call the schools directly to double check the num- bers. 

"We found keypunch errors and principals who did not read definitions or follow simple instructions," Watson said. 

Scott Smallwood of the Albuquerque Jour- nal, said it's important to ask how crimes are 

reported - whether the principal tells some- one or students go directly to officers on cam- pus. 

He also found those schools with more se- rious crime and drug problems tended to be more diligent in reporting. 

"(Under-reporting) is probably more likely with the lesser incidents - from vandalism to simple assault to disorderly conduct. Our feel- ing was it would be harder to keep quiet about robberies, rapes and serious assaults with of- ficers patrolling the campuses," he said. 

But ultimately the only way to overcome discrepancies in the data is an old-fashioned technique called interviewing people. Talk to students, educators, police officers, state offi- cials and anyone else who can shed some light on the "reality" behind the numbers. 

And finally, be extremely careful in how you report the numbers. Be sure to clarify any dis- crepancies and throw out any numbers or com- parisons that you can't verify as accurate.

FIRST VENTURE 

# Learning the hard part 

## By Jodi Nirode 

The Columbus Dispatch I was so idealistic. After finishing IRE and NICAR boot camp this summer I thought the hardest part about doing my first solo computer-assisted reporting project would be writing Access queries. How quickly I learned how many pitfalls there can be along the way. The project was looking at the response times of Columbus police. On Mother's Day, a 48-year-old man was shot and killed in front of his children and grandchildren - 30 minutes after a neighbor warned a police dispatcher that a drunk man was firing shots from his front stoop. Police called the delay a fluke - that rare case when more important calls bogged them down from getting to a run that should have been the division's second highest priority. The Dispatch wanted to know for sure. I requested a year's worth of the 911 dis- patch records. In my request, I stated I wanted nothing omitted and I wanted them in a comma-delimited text format. Simple, right? 

I should have asked for them to give it to me in Access originally. I just never dreamed they had it. It taught me the first of many valuable lessons that would resurface later - never assume. 

However, the woman placed in charge of my request gave me separate files for each day - 366 in all. So I'd have to input and link each file for every Access query. 

The dispatchers comments weren't in- cluded, I later learned, because they are stored separately. 

So, I had to make the request again. 

And again, the files came back in separate databases. 

The head of the department gave me a technical argument about the information being too large to store in one text file; if I wanted it in one file, he could do it, but in Access only. 

God, did I feel dumb. I should have asked for them to give it to me in Access originally. I just never dreamed they had it. It taught me the first of many valuable lessons that would resurface later - never assume. 

## The data work 

Alas, finally after about a month of wait- ing and re-requesting, I had my data. I was so excited. I signed out a new IBM Winbook and interviewed the 897,870 records or calls that Columbus police took that year. (By the way, I was defining response time as the time it took between the time the call was dis- patched to when the first police cruiser ar- rived on the scene.) 

I queried the data every which way. Aver- age response times for gun runs, domestic calls, dead bodies, burglaries, stabbings-you name it. 

I looked at medians. Then I looked at re- sponse times by shift and precinct using Excel's pivot table. (What a marvelous inven- tion.) 

I knew going into the project that nearly 50 percent of police in Columbus weren't logging their arrival times. It was disappoint- ing, but we planned to use the data anyway and note the problem. 

As I saw it, the information I had to use was the only information the division had to make important decisions such as staff allo- cations, requests for more manpower and citi- zen complaints. The response times might not be dead on, but I thought they would still show disparities in response times be- tween the larger and smaller precincts. (Of course, with the help of data processing I did some more sophisticated queries first to see if the lack of reporting was similar across the city's 19 precincts and it remained fairly con- stant for all types of calls.) 

What I didn't anticipate was a program- ming quirk that plugs in the same time for

Have you or one of your colleagues recently published a story using CAR that has not been done before or has involved particularly difficult data work? 

Do you know of a technical problem (or its solution) that others may like to hear about?

when the call was received, dispatched and when the officer arrived. 

The self-initiated run, as Columbus po- lice call it, is supposed to be used when an officer witnesses a crime or calls the run into a dispatcher shortly after it happens. 

Those runs, though, comprised 28.9 per- cent and couldn't be used. Factoring those out, we had about 21 percent of the total calls to use. 

Three independent statisticians assured us the data would still be fine to use if we stipu- lated that the averages were averages of the data available - and not averages of the divi- sion as a whole. 

## A new direction 

As controversial as it might have been, the thought of using it didn't last long. Doing queries on the data without the self-initiated runs showed how skewed the data can get when you start slicing it too much. 

Response times for officer in trouble - a call officers use when their life or well-being is in danger - jumped to 8 minutes. (With- out self-initiated runs, the average was about 3 minutes.) I knew the 8 minute-average was not only absurd, it was false. 

Though a young reporter, I've covered police on and off for six years and knew that was the call that police likely responded to the quickest. 

Going back to police communications I got the answer I dreaded. The 911 system plugs in arrival times for the first car on scene who logs his arrival time. 

So for example, if an officer shows up an 

hour later to handle traffic and is the first on scene to hit a button on his cruiser console signifying his arrival, that's the time the 911 data shows. I knew then, the project as planned was dead. Of course, there was still a very impor- tant story: that the division has no idea how long they take to get to crime scenes. They can't. Of course, in retrospect I felt dumb for assuming the arrival time listed in the data- base was for the same officer listed on the department's run. Next time, I'll be very thorough in finding out how information gets plugged into each column. In the end, the story prompted outrage by the City Safety Director and others, but no change. The director ordered the officers be forced to record their arrival times, but the police contract has a provision that the city can't alter any past practices, unless changed in the contract. And the Fraternal Order of Police didn't see the lack of response times as a problem, so the director's order was moot. The division is caught up in a battle too with the U.S. Department of Justice over claims that they abuse citizen's rights, so even with follow-ups, the issue is still likely going to be lost in the shuffle. It was a lot of work to uncover a record- keeping problem, but I sure learned a lot along the way. Jodi Nirode can be reached by e-mail at jnirode@dispatch.com

out rates and test scores, to examine any pos- sible correlation. Those went into a sidebar, 

Our immediate editors were helpful in freeing up some time for us to finish the project. But because the newsroom doesn't have a long history with computer-assisted reporting, others thought the stories would be ready the day after the school district gave us 400 pages of printed reports. 

A few weeks ago, the district released its 

newest violence and vandalism report. A new state law requires them to break it down by school site and for the first time officials gave individualized reports to each principal about crime and violence in his or her school. Also, after our fight in the spring, we were able to get the data electronically that same day.

CAMPAIGN FINANCE 

# The Bush files 

## By Aaron Diamant IRE and NICAR staff 

Amidst a great deal of self-congratula- tory hype, George W. Bush has made avail- able on his Web site ww.georgew bush.com) a complete list of every single campaign contribution he has ever re- ceived. Sounds great, except it's nearly impossible to work with. The problem is that the data are only available as one giant pdf file (and I mean a giant 1,750 pages and counting as of this writing and that's only for the 3rd quarter of 1999). So although the data don't cost you a dime, you really can't do anything with them unless you have lots of time and specialized software to convert them into a workable format. A few of you have written to the NICAR-L listserv in the last few months asking for help converting the monster .pdf file into a format that can be imported into Excel or Access. And as the 2000 election gets closer, more of you will be asked to take a look at, and produce stories on, the Bush cam- paign finance data from your area. The following are some methods oth- ers have used: 

## MacGyver method 

This is the method used by reporters at The New York Times. Step 1. Write two PostScript programs that go automatically to the Bush Web site. One version should read the page and download the .pdf files you need. How- ever, you don't want to download all the files after the first time. A second version of the PostScript goes to the directory and checks for the most recent additions. Step 2. Load the data into Adobe Ex- change with a "Redwing" plug-in designed by Monarch. This extracts text from a .pdf file. Use the "Extract all to Monarch" command that parses the text. You may run into a problem with the multi-line for- mat of the original data (sometimes there is a second line added for comments which can be lost). To solve it, go to step 3. 

Step 3. Run a PostScript that checks for spaces at the beginning of lines. If 

there is a space, write the script such that it will save the comment as a separate field. Step 4. Export as Tab Delimited. Step 5. Load into Access. Degree of difficulty: 9.5. Not recom- mended for anyone except the most seri- ous programmers. 

## Mother Theresa method 

For those of you who are fairly patient, this method may be for you. It is much simpler than the previous method, but there are more limitations. There is an Acrobat Reader plug-in called Aerial, which a number of you may be familiar with. You can use Aerial to convert a .pdf to an .rtf document. This is a good tool for copying a table at once and pasting it into Excel. It can convert the whole .pdf document at once, but is not infallible. This is where the Mother Theresa part comes in. Once you convert the .pdf to an .rtf document you can use a word processing program such as Microsoft Word to clean the data and convert it to the format of your choice for import into a spreadsheet or database. You can download a trial version of Aerial from www.ambia.comlaerial.htm. For help using Aerial you can refer to an article written by IRE's Training Director Tom McGinty in the July/August edition of Uplink. Degree of difficulty: 5. 

## Fed Ex method 

If you need to get data from a .pdf file that's posted on the Web, you can send a message to pdf2txt@adobe.com with the URL of the .pdf in the body of the mes- sage. The contents of the .pdf should be returned to you as a text message. You should get a response in a few minutes (sometimes a lot longer for larger files like the Bush .pdf). But be warned, you are going to have to clean the data yourself. Degree of difficulty: 4 

## Indiana Jones method 

Indy was known for hunting for things that are already out there. Believe it or not there are actually a number of sites that 

Bush data sources: www.georgewbush.com - George W. Bush's Web site, where the public can access his campaign contribution reports in .pdf format.

-At this site, you can download a trial version of Aerial, a software program that can help translate .pdf documents.

These are takes from a Sept. 30 discussion on the NICAR-L listero regarding confidence levels used in Census Bureau data. See sidebar for in- formation on how to subscribe to NICAR-L. 

No doubt some of you are working to- day with the Census Bureau's just-released income and poverty rates. Naturally, I'm looking at Colorado's numbers in compari- son to the other states. 

The state-by-state estimates of median in- come and of poverty rates are accompanied by measurements of standard error. Does anyone know the confidence level associated with these standard errors? The appendices dealing with how to work with standard er- ror seem to indicate that the confidence in- terval, at least for U.S.-level estimates, is 90 percent. Does that same confidence interval hold for the state-level estimates? 

A specific example: Colorado's three-year average median income is $44,349. The standard error is $1,075. 

Would I, then, be correct in saying some- thing like this: "The Census Bureau is 90 percent certain that Colorado's median an- nual income ranged between $43,274 and $45,424." 3 

A corollary question: Which of the median income (or poverty rate) measures is best to use? The three-year averages? The most recent 2-year rolling average? - Jeff Thomas, The Gazette, Colorado Springs, Colo. 

The state-level data also is reported at the 

90% c.l. [confidence level] This is noted in Table D in the footnote for the percent change column (those percent changes that are statis- tically significant). The Census release uses the three-year average for income (see the bulleted item on Alaska's income). This gives them a dartboard that's a bit larger. - Neill Borowski, The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia, Penn. The Census Bureau usually reports er- for margins at one standard error, which means the confidence level is 68 percent. I don't have the report to which you refer, so can't evaluate the indication that it is 90 per- cent. But for 90 percent confidence, accord- ing to sampling theory, you need an error band that is 1.65 standard errors wide. - Philip Meyer, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, N.C. This is a common mistake in interpret- ing confidence intervals. We cannot be cer- tain that the true mean (or whatever param- eter) falls within the confidence interval. The correct way to interpret a confidence interval is to say: "In repeated sampling, our range (confidence interval) would encom- pass the true mean 90% of the time." Thus, if we were to sample from a population 100 more times and determine the mean and re- spective intervals for each of those samples, then 90 of the intervals would contain the true population mean. - Mary A. Davis, Center for Environmental Studies, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Va.

EYE ON LAWMAKERS 

# Staff travel records 

By Derek Willis and Jackie Koszczuk 

Congressional Quarterly Weekly In the past decade, Congress has tried to distance itself from some of the perks of law- making, especially gifts from lobbyists. The law on Capitol Hill is that members and staff members can't accept gifts such as meals and baseball tickets that exceed $100 a year per donor - a relatively paltry sum by most stan- dards. 

But that doesn't stop officials from tak- ing trips to Hawaii, Switzerland and Las Vegas on the tabs of corporations and spe- cial interests who often have an interest in influencing legislation. An exemption in the law allows private travel as long as it is related to "official duties" and is not paid for by lobbyists. 

Travel records are stored in two places on Capitol Hill... Lawmakers and staffers fill out one of two basic forms, but early on we discovered that each body differed in its organization of the records. 

In an effort to examine the link between these privately-financed trips and legisla- tion, Congressional Quarterly looked at the travel records of leading members of Con- gress and their staffs. We found that pri- vate interests spent nearly $3 million on 2,042 trips for committee chairmen, rank- ing members and key staffers between January 1998 and May 1999. 

## How It Started 

I had been looking for alternate sources of data on Congress, and while other or- ganizations have examined travel records 

before, most excluded staff travel from their analyses. We decided to include staffers because they often specialize in certain areas and because some top aides are nearly as pow- erful in shaping legislation as the members themselves. 

Travel records are stored in two places on Capitol Hill: the Senate's Public Records of- fice, in the Hart Office Building, and the House Legislative Resource Center, in the Can- non Office Building. Lawmakers and staffers fill out one of two basic forms, but early on we discovered that each body differed in its orga- nization of the records. In the Senate, we ob- tained travel records for 1998 on microfilm for $20, but they were arranged alphabetically by the last name of the person who traveled. That made the process of ensuring that we had every record for each of the lawmakers that we wanted difficult. 

The House did not offer microfilm but grouped records by member and included staff- ers with the member they worked for. Neither body had the records available electronically, and no plans are in place for that to happen, despite the fact that travelers often download the form off a House Web site and fill it out by hand. Instead of paying photocopying fees for most of the remaining records, I took a por- table scanner to the Capitol and scanned in the forms. 

We did the data entry ourselves, with help from two members of CQ's research staff. The research staff also helped fact-check a percent- age of the records before publication to avoid any mistakes. Creating the Microsoft Access database of trips took about 5 weeks, although none of us worked on the project full-time during that period. 

The data was fairly clean, although we en- countered several forms filled out improperly and some that neglected to mention basic in- formation about the trip, including the desti- nation and time span. We answered those ques- tions by contacting the traveler. After the in- put process, we added several fields to calcu- late the length of each trip and the total cost, since the forms break it down to several cat- egories. 

Reporting the Story Analyzing the data was much faster: we were Continued on page ten

interested in seeing which lawmakers and their staffs traveled the most, or what for- eign destination was most popular. For the story, we tried to focus on aspects of the trips that would link travel and legislation, and to describe details of junkets to Palm Springs, Calif., Las Vegas and Cape Cod, Mass. 

We also produced several charts for the story that listed the leading destinations and top sponsors of travel, among other things. Internet search engines such as Northern Light (www.nlsearch.com) were helpful in gleaning more information about some of the leading sponsors, in- cluding Taiwan's main business lobby, the Chinese National Association of Industry & Commerce. 

What we found was that some staffers spent more than 30 days on all-expenses- paid trips during the 17-month period, and that several groups had penchants for taking key members and their staffs to exotic destinations in the thick of winter: recycling seminars in Key West, aviation 

conferences in Hawaii and telecommunica- tions roundtables in Palm Springs. 

But the story also found that despite the ban on lobbyist-paid travel, most of the groups that sponsored trips concentrated on members who headed a committee or sub- committee with jurisdiction over their in- dustries. The Nuclear Energy Institute, for example, paid for seven trips by Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, and his staff. Murkowski heads the Senate Energy panel. 

As with campaign finance stories, ex- amples of direct quid pro quo, where a trip was traded in exchange for beneficial legis- lation, were scarce. Instead, we chose to shine a light on the loophole that allows organiza- tions lobbying Congress to pay for members and staffers to travel for free, and show just how friendly the skies can be when you work on Capitol Hill.

have the Bush data available without do- ing all the grunt-work. It has all been done for you. Here are three possible options: 

First, Tony Raymond of Public Disclo- sure, Inc. and the Web site www.tray.com has worked to put electronically filed presi- dential data in a Microsoft Access data- base or .dbf format that you can down- load right off the site. He has the data online shortly after they're filed with the Federal Elections Commission. 

Another choice: check out food org/bush.html. This organization prints the data to a PostScript file from Adobe Exchange, then parses them based on the position in the file. The original dataset is not available here but you can search their database by name, address, city, date, occupation, em- ployer, etc. 

But the best place that I've found to get the original data is off of Elliotte 

Harold's Web site (http://metalab.unc.edu/ javafaq/bush). Harold teaches courses in Java and object oriented programming in the Computer Science Department of Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, New York. He has extracted the ASCII text from those .pdf documents and posted them as tab-delimited documents that can be easily imported into any good spread- sheet or database. 

Degree of difficulty: 2. The fact that the data are so hard for the average journalist to deal with raises the question of the sincerity with which the Bush camp released them under the guise of full public disclosure. But as jour- nalists, most of us enjoy a good challenge. And for that we thank you Mr. Bush, be- cause most of us are paid by the hour.

STATS AND SUCH 

# Economic census 

## By Neill A. Borowski The Philadelphia Inquirer 

"Imputed" and "estimated" should be two words that wave red flags and set off alarms for users of census and other government data. Those words mean the information in ques- tion didn't come directly from the source. In some cases, the data represent the agency's "best guess" in the absence of solid statistics. 

The cautions of using estimated data are particularly true for the Census Bureau's Eco- nomic Census program (more on the program below), which this fall has been releasing data from the 1997 survey of establishments. 

The Census Bureau's economic censuses, taken every five years in years that end in "2" or "7," are not full censuses. Questionnaires are sent to multi-unit and large single-unit busi- nesses. But smaller firms aren't included in the survey. 

When data are missing, the bureau will try to use administrative records from other fed- eral agencies, such as the Social Security Ad- ministration or the Internal Revenue Service. And when even that information isn't avail- able, it turns to imputation-estima based on industry averages or historic company in- formation. 

An example of imputation gone wrong was apparent in September when the bureau re- leased the 1997 Economic Census for Educa- tional Services. This report focuses on propri- etary schools of business, technology and cos- metology, among other subjects. 

I was interested in building a table from this report for the counties in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. When I reached Montgom- ery County, which is Philadelphia's largest sub- urban county, the data leaped out of the page at me. Now, here was a great news story. 

The census reported that total revenues from educational services firms were just un- der $300 million for Montgomery County - almost three times the total revenues for such firms in Philadelphia. The annual payroll of such firms was $108 million, again about three times that of Philadelphia. And the number of employees was 4,427, nearly four times that of Philadelphia. 

## Learning the truth 

Such a good story. You almost hate to ruin 

it with a phone call to make sure the data are correct. But this report seemed far out of whack. 

Indeed, the report was wrong - forcing the Census Bureau to not only recalculate the Montgomery County totals, but also the metro and state numbers. "We simply missed it (the error) during our analysis," said Bar- bara S. Tinari, a survey statistician on the economic census team. The formula used to estimate the Montgomery County numbers didn't work in this case. 

Instead of $298 million in revenues, the figure should be about $75 million. Instead of $108 million in payroll, the figure should be about $25 million. And instead of 4,427 employees, the number should be about 1,500. 

Tinari wasn't pleased about the error, but she was pleased to have it pointed out. The problem, she explained, was in the bureau's estimation procedure for Montgomery County. Nationally, only about 13.5 percent of the data for educational services came from estimates. However, 78 percent of the Mont- gomery County total was from estimates. (Only 11.7 percent of Philadelphia's data came from estimates.) 

The lesson? Get to know the data and read the appendices to the report. They will let you know just how frail the data can be. The economic censuses are forthright about data from administrative records and estimation - a separate column lets the user know how much came from each source. For other types of government data, you may have to dig a bit deeper. 

## The program 

Having cited the potential problems with imputed data, I want to also urge you to check out the economic censuses for your area. If the data don't spark solid business and economic stories, they should be great sources of graphics or supporting paragraphs for other stories.

For example, in Wisconsin, we'll train with Wisconsin state and federal contribution data. A seminar is being planned in Minneapolis sometime in April, but the dates are not confirmed yet. Watch campaign finance.org/training for more details. 

Here are the seminar dates:

Feb. 26-27 

Springfield, III. 

March 4-5 

Madison, Wis. 

March 24-25 

Indianapolis, Ind. 

This advice from David Milliron, CAR editor at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, was posted on NICAR-L on Oct. 19. 

How can you import a large group of files of the same type into an Access 97 database? 

The Import Specification tool and the TransferTex function (in the Macro tab section) is one way to accomplish this. 

Let's say you receive weekly crime data in tab-delimited text files that you want to maintain in your "crime" database. You save the weekly crime.txt files to the "crime" folder on your "F" drive. (You can substitute any file name) 

It may be easier to manually import the first week's data - where you can also use the "advanced settings" option to specify which fields are to be imported and any specialty data format, etc. Then save the "import specification" for future use. 

To create a specification table for the "crime.txt" file: 

1. Open your "crime" database. 
2. On the File menu, click Get Exter- nal Data, then select Import. 
3. In the Import box, select Text Files under Files of type. 
4. Select the crime.tx file from your F:\crime folder, then click Import. 
5. Select delimited, then click Next. 
6. In the Import Text Wizard box, select tab delimited (the first row of our data does not include field names). 
7. In the Import Text Wizard box, click Advanced, make any necessary changes in the Field Information, then click Save As and accept the "Crime Import Specification" default name by select- ing OK in the Save Import/Export Specification box. 
8. Click Cancel in the "Crime Import Specification" box. 
9. Click Cancel in the "Import Text Wizard" box. 

"Crime Import Specification" file. Then: 

You didn't import any data doing this, but you'll want to test your newly created 

1. Open your "crime" database. 
2. On the File menu, click Get Exter- nal Data, then select Import. 
3. In the Import box, select Text Files under Files of type. 
4. Select the crime. file from your F:\crime folder, then click Import. 
5. Select Advanced. 
6. Select Specs, then choose the "Crime Import Specification" import speci- fication you created above. Click Open, click OK, click Finished. 

Now you're ready to create a macro and put the "TransferText" command to use. 

1. In the Crime database, click the MACRO tab and select New. 
2. Under Action choose TransferText. 
3. At the bottom of the screen in the Ac- tion Arguments section: 
A. In the Transfer Type section, select Import Delimited. 
B. In the Specification Name section (the specification name for the set of op tions that determines how a text file is imported, exported, or linked) select the "Crime Import Specification" im- port selection criteria you created ear- lier. 
C. In the Table Name section, enter Crime (see assumptions above) 
D. In the File Name section, enter f:\crime\crime.txt (see assumptions above) 
E. In the Has Field Names section, select No. 
F. Save the Macro as Update Crime Data and you're ready to append future file updates. 

Note: All files must be the same name each week.

# Continued from page one: Conviction rate 

The OBTS data included the total num- ber of felony arrests for a given county, the number of cases dropped by law enforcement agencies, the number of cases declined by county prosecutors, total complaints actually filed and their outcomes - conviction, ac- quittal, dismissal, non-judicial diversion and prison or jail sentence. Every California county has contributed to the dataset for more than two decades, and the federal Bureau of Criminal Statistics in Washington, D.C. considers California's data to be highly reliable. Because I wanted to calculate and com- pare conviction, dismissal and diversion rates, the OBTS dataset was ideal for my study of the effectiveness of the San Francisco DA's office. 

I contacted the state Attorney General and requested OBTS data for San Francisco County from 1988 through 1997 (the last year for which data was available at the time of the request). The reason for this historical spread was to compare DA Hallinan's new administration (1996-1999) with his prede- cessor. Eventually, I requested three years of identical OBTS data for all the Bay Area Counties, and for the entire state of Califor- nia. When 1998 statistics became available this summer, I also requested those for all California counties. 

## Studying the data 

I began receiving the data in the form of unprocessed hard copy spreadsheets within a couple of weeks, and immediately sat down to examine it using lead pencils, a ruler, a calculator and a pad of analyst's paper. After I was satisfied that I understood the relation- ships between the various subsets of num- bers for each county, I used Microsoft Excel to construct computer spreadsheets, calcu- late various rates and make tables that ranked the results. 

Because I was dealing with about 30 data fields for 58 counties for each year in my spreads, I hand entered the numbers directly from the DOJ spreadsheets, then cross checked them for accuracy before setting up my formula cells for calculation. The pro- cess took only a few hours at each phase of the project. 

I used the same techniques for determin- ing conviction rates that are used by the state Attorney General: dividing convictions by total arrests to obtain the rate as a percent- age of the total universe of possible cases in each jurisdiction, and dividing convictions by complaints filed to obtain the conviction rate as the percentage of cases each DA con- sidered worthy of pursuing. I determined "nol pros" (decline to file) rates by dividing the complaints denied by the total number of arrests. I also calculated dismissal and diversion rates by the two methods I had used for convictions. Finally, I corroborated the trends my sta- tistical information seemed to indicate by looking at two independent and unrelated datasets. One was the number of cases that had gone to trial in San Francisco over the last seven years from the California Judicial Council. The other was the California De- partment of Correction's data on the total number of convicted criminals sent to state prison over the last seven years by authori- ties in San Francisco. 

## Behind the trends 

All three datasets verified my original source's tip: conviction rates in San Francisco had dropped under Hallinan's administration while dismissals and refused cases had climbed steeply. The number of cases going to trial under the new DA was steadily de- creasing, as was the number of cases result- ing in prison sentences. All of these previously unreported trends were newsworthy, but I still wasn't satisfied that I understood why they were happen- ing. In order to find out, I examined 100 felony criminal files from San Francisco Su- perior Court just to see what was actually happening in a substantial - but still man- ageable - number of cases. I made no at- tempt to pull a scientific sample but simply pulled cases at random from the alphabetic court index by the criminal code section in the leading charge (187 for homicide, 245 for assault, 11,350 for drug possession, etc.) This review, which I also summarized in Excel spreadsheet format, showed that most cases, including violent crimes, were indeed being plea-bargained, despite Hallinan's

# Conviction rate 

Contined from page thirteen: 

Bill Wallace's story on conviction rates is available on the San Francisco Chronicle's Web site at: www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/ article.cgi?file=/chroniclel archive/1999/09/02/ MN3825.DTL 

Where to find information on conviction rates? Every state Attorney General publishes an annual report that is likely to contain some conviction rate data, even if they only reflect state totals. Most of these reports are available online at the AG's Web site. The U.S. Justice Department (www.usdoj.gov) maintains a host of different law enforcement data sets that can be accessed as Adobe files, and some of these data can be downloaded directly into a PC spreadsheet program. In addition, some progressive prosecutors will make case disposition data available on their own Web pages. 

pledge to reduce plea bargaining to zero or nearly zero" in violent crime cases. In the process, a substantial number of criminal charges were being dropped. 

The case survey also showed that many defendants were being sentenced to brief jail terms and probation - and that a large pro- portion of those who received probation were rearrested again within months for new of- fenses. 

I finished off the study with a 90-minute interview with Hallinan in which I queried him at length about this statistical picture of his office's performance and about specific cases that I had uncovered. The result was a package of stories, charts and photographs that ran on page one of the Chronicle and broke to two full inside pages. 

## Story response 

In response to the package, Hallinan and his supporters argued three major points: First, that his conviction rate only appears low because his staff has to weed out many bad arrests by the San Francisco police, while other California police agencies themselves kick out cases without sending them to the district attorney's office. Second, that San Francisco sends many defendants to diver- sion programs instead of jail or prison; using non-judicial diversion is a progressive but non-traditional approach to justice that has the effect of reducing a prosecutor's convic- tion rate, since diversions are officially con- sidered dismissals. 

The number of cases going to trial under the new DA was steadily decreasing, as was the number of cases resulting in prison sentences. 

Finally, they said Hallinan's approach to- ward criminal cases had proven itself effec- tive because reported crimes had dropped 

dramatically in San Francisco during his ad- ministration. 

Because neither Hallinan nor his support- ers understood the state data, all three argu- ments were completely off point. Cases thrown out by police agencies before review by county prosecutors accounted for only 4 percent of the total arrests in California in 1998. Police in the three California coun- ties that Hallinan pointed to as typical, Los Angeles, Alameda and San Diego, dropped the vast majority of those cases. However, despite the police drops, prosecutors in those three counties still filed complaints in a larger percentage of arrests than Hallinan. 

More importantly, all three had a signifi- cantly higher conviction rate than Hallinan after weak cases were weeded out - regard- less of whether police or prosecutors had done the weeding. 

Second, the number of cases sent to diver- sion by Hallinan - although higher than in any other county in California-we only 636 out of 16,614 arrests, less than four percent of the total. This minuscule percentage did not begin to account for Hallinan's low convic- tion rate or huge 32 percent dismissal rate. 

Finally, while it is true that crime has dropped substantially in San Francisco in recent years, crime reports have dropped in most U.S. jurisdictions during the same pe- riod. In addition, the crime categories in which San Francisco's largest decreases have occurred are offenses like murder and rape that occur in relatively small numbers in the first place. 

In those categories, even a modest numeri- cal decline yields a whopping percentage de- crease. In addition, those large decreases be- gan before Hallinan took office, so it is more likely that they are related to shifting U.S. demographic patterns than Hallinan's law enforcement strategies. 

In the month since the story first ap- peared, neither Hallinan nor his supporters have found one error of fact in the Chronicle's study. As the district attorney himself said in responding to the story, "the proof of the pudding is in the eating."

# Continued from page eleven: Economic census 

As of mid-October, for example, the Educational Services and the Health Care and Social Assis- tance reports had been released for each state. 

One advantage to the Economic Censuses is that they go beyond the county level and offer some data on larger cities and townships. The other major census business product, County Business Patterns, doesn't go below the county level. How- ever, the advantage to County Business Patterns is that it comes out every year. The 1997 County Business Patterns reports were released in early October (available at abslcbptotal. html). 

The Economic Census also reports on total receipts (revenues) for each sector. Both the Eco- nomic Census and County Business Patterns re- port on total establishments, employees and pay- roll in each sector. 

Other 1997 Economic Censuses that will come out over the next two years include Whole- sale Trade; Retail Trade; Real Estate and Rental and Leasing; Professional, Scientific and Techni- cal Services; Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services; Arts, Entertainment and Recreation and Accom- modation and Foodservices. 

Yet another wrinkle in the Economic Census 

is the move to the new North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), which is a revi- sion of the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system of separating industries. The change makes comparisons of industries over time a problem, if not impossible for some sectors. As the bureau notes: "The implementation of NAICS will cause major disruptions in the avail- ability of comparable information across time periods. In the last 30 years, the SIC system was updated three times. and each time a significant number of new industries was introduced into the existing framework. What is different for 1997 is that the whole framework has changed." The new NAICS structure, however, does make some of the data richer. For example, under the SIC system, hotels and motels were classified as 7011. Under NAICS, there are separate list- ings for casino hotels and bed-and-breakfast inns. Each geographic report is an Acrobat .pdf file. The Aerial plug-in and Acrobat Exchange easily turned the tables into spreadsheets. You also can purchase the data on a series of CD- ROMs. Neill Borowski can be reached by e-mail at inborowski@phillynews.com. 

## Conviction data advice 

Here are some suggestions from Bill Wallace can be used to cross check your primary data for others attempting to look at conviction rates: or illuminate aspects of it. 

First, be sure you understand the relation- ship between the various subsets of numbers in the statistical data you obtain, and use only stats that are directly comparable to each other. In other words, use numbers that mea- sure the same things and don't mix them up. 

The key is understanding the subsets of numbers you are working with. If you are completely clear on what it is that each sec- tion of your data actually represents, you can't go wrong. A good tip is to take a single col- umn of data and use simple arithmetic to clearly understand how each subset relates to the total. 

Second, look for other sorts of statistical information from unrelated sources - like data on the number of prison remands per year, jury trials versus pleas, the number of felony cases versus misdemeanors, etc. - that 

Third, be ready to test any conclusions you draw about how cases are being handled in your jurisdiction by going down to the courthouse and looking at lots of cases. Case reviews will provide much of the detail and color you need to flesh out a largely statisti- cal story, and will also give you information about the way cases are actually being pro- cessed in the criminal justice system. 

Finally, never hesitate to discuss your ap- proach and findings with people who are knowledgeable about how the system works. I got some of my most valuable guidance by discussing my project with law professors, trial lawyers and statisticians and sharing my findings with them as I went along. No doubt this prevented me from making serious er- rors of fact and helped me to more fully un- derstand what my data were showing me.

## SAS and SPSS 

CAR specialists who use SAS and SPSS software for data management and statistical analysis - and those who want to learn more about these high-end programs - are invited 

to join the new SASCAR-L e-mail list recently created by Steve Doig of Arizona State University. 

SASCAR-L is for reporters who need specific techni- cal help with those programs. More general questions about computer-assisted reporting, including help with statistical techniques, still should be posted to NICAR-L. 

To join SASCAR-L, send this message - SUB- SCRIBE SASCAR-L firstname lastname - to this ad- dress: listserv@asu.edu. You can also visit the SASCAR website at http://cronkite.pp.asu.edu/sascar/for more infor- mation and tips.
