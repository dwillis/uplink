Spy vs. Spy 

## Uplink update 

You can run, but you can't hide. This issue of Uplink reveals how to background a subject with on- line and other resources. Neil Reisner of The Miami Herald, and formerly NICAR's training director, describes Web resources, commercial ser- vices, and data brokers that can make backgrounding easier. In the Handout of the Month, Jennifer LaFleur of The San Jose Mercury News, and a former NICAR training director, shares numerous CD-ROM research resources. In other stories, Dave Sheingold of the Westchester Rockland News examines the excessive burdens that bridges bear, and Scott Glover of the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel takes a fresh look at pawnshops and the criminals - er, clientele they serve. Also, don't miss the brand-new NashCAR schedule of events on page twelve. And, on page eight, catch up with NICAR and IRE news - including the addition of Sarah Cohen as our new training director.

# Dig for on-line gold 

## By Neil Reisner 

The Miami (Fla.) Herald Time was when backgrounding a story subject wasn't for the fainthearted. It meant leafing through sheaves of yel- lowed clips, poring through dusty vol- umes, and reviewing sheaves of public records. Only the high-powered investi- gator with all the time in the world would attempt to deeply background a subject; the ordinary beat reporter work- ing on daily deadlines didn't stand a chance. Even the privileged reporters who had the time to delve deeply into a subject's past wouldn't go on-line. Re- sources such as Lexis/Nexis, Dialog, Datatimes, and Dow Jones News Ser- vice were too expensive and not avail- able to mere reporters. 

## Net explosion 

The explosion of the Internet and other on-line services has changed all that. Indeed, much of the information that once was available only by combing through books and dusty paper records or by paying hundreds of dollars for high-priced databases now can be ob- tained for no more than the $20 monthly it costs to connect with a local Internet provider or the $9.95 per month sub- scription to a commercial on-line ser- vice such as CompuServe or America On-line. 

## Don't misunderstand 

Clips, Lexis/Nexis, Dialog and hard copy volumes such as "Who's Who in [fill in the blank]" are still invaluable resources that should be used if they are 

available. But journalists who want to mine all there is to know about their subjects - or even get basic information on deadline - do well to expand their horizons beyond the stalwarts. All it takes is a couple of on-line connections, ordinary journalistic curiosity, and a sense of adventure. Assuming you already have a com- puter, a modem running at a speed no Continued on page two

## Backgrounding sites 

By Neil Reisner 

The Miami (Fla.) Herald Several sites provide useful start- ing points for reporters beginning to background people and busi- nesses on-line. One of the best is maintained by Nora Paul, the Poynter Institute's ace news researcher: an on-line ver- sion of her book "Computer-As- sisted Research," that can function as an on-line tutorial. 

The URL is: http://www. poynter.org/poynter/chome.html 

What may surprise many jour- nalists, though, is that there is a whole other profession whose mem- bers are as interested in backgrounding people as they are. These are "prospect researchers,"

NICAR is a joint effort of Investigative Reporters and Editors and the University of Missouri School of Journalism. NICAR services include hands-on newsroom training on computer- assisted reporting, special academic and advanced training in data analysis. NICAR is supported by a grant from The Freedom Forum and other foundations intended to help the institute deliver its services nationwide to news organizations and associations. 

slower than 28.8 kilobytes per second, a phone line and communication software to let them all talk to one another, you also need: 

An Internet account that provides access to the World Wide Web. This should cost about $20 monthly through either a national or local Internet Service Provider (ISP) and will let you surf the Web for as many hours as you like, using a Web browser such as Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Explorer. 
An account with a commercial on-line service such as America Online or CompuServe. America Online recently changed its price to $19.95 for unlimited ac- cess, mirroring most ISPs. CompuServe costs $9.95 monthly, including five hours of access, with additional hours at $2.95. CompuServe, especially, has deep research databases and is generally regarded a superior research tool. Either service also provides access to the World Wide Web, but the connections offered by ISPs are often faster and more stable. 
An account with a private data broker such as Database Technologies, CDB Infotek or IRSC, providing on-line access to specific information on individuals, their property hold- ings, etc. Some services can tell you what kind of car a prospect drives, how much his home and other property is worth, whether she owns an airplane, and more. 

## The World Wide Web 

The World Wide Web has achieved near divine status in the pop-culture consciousness. And the Web likely is the greatest (though least organized) collection of information known to humankind. It's all there wheat, chaff, and in between - in amounts that rapidly become overwhelming. The trick is to use the Web well, to learn how to focus your Web surfing so that you quickly get close to what you want. 

There is a myth that the World Wide Web is the Internet, but it's not. The Internet is simply a worldwide network of interconnected computer networks. Strip away all the hype and the Web is merely a means to navigate the Internet by way of an easy-to-use "point and click" interface. All you really need to know is that you use a "browser" such as Netscape or Microsoft Explorer to move around the Web 

and that a Web address looks something like this: http://www.nicar.org/nashcan Known as a "Universal Resource Locator" or "URL," this address directs the Web browser to open a particular Web page; all Web pages have an address that resembles it. In this case, the URL tells the Internet that you want to connect to a World Wide Web (the "www' portion of the URL) site called "nicar.org." At that site, you want to see a directory called "nashcar" and display the page that directory is instructed to load by default. In this case, there is no need to indicate the name of the page; in other cases, the URL would include another layer, perhaps some- thing like "index.html." Knowing a little bit more about Internet ad- dresses can help a lot. For example the ".org" in the above address signals that the page is located on a computer connected to a nonprofit organization. The ad- dress would end in ".edu" if the site were associ- ated with an educational institution; ".gov" if it's an official government site; ".mil" if it's military; ".net," if the page is on a computer attached to an ISP; and ".com" if it's associated with a business, such as Chrysler, or if the site is maintained on a commercial service such as CompuServe. This "domain hierarchy" can help you evalu- ate the quality of the information provided. The data available on a site associated with "www. chrysler.com," for example, is more likely to be official company information than an address pointing to "www.aol.com/~chrysler" a (fictional) Web page on an America Online computer. What can you find? More than you possibly could imagine. Web sites will help you locate prospects' ad- dresses and telephone numbers, articles written about them, and the socioeconomics of the neigh- borhoods where they live. There are Web sites through which you can background the bona fides of doctors and lawyers, where you can get the most recent filings of most publicly held compa- nies and business information on many privately held firms. There are "search engines" that in seconds will let you scan every word on millions of Web pages for references to your subject.

available for free on the Internet. That means that Lexis/Nexises of the world are not likely to go away. Neither are the America Onlines and CompuServes of the world, where much of the same information is available at lower cost. While AOL provides easy e-mail facilities and access to somewhat wider variety of current publications, CompuServe is generally regarded as a better source for business researchers. Many of its offerings carry surcharges above the basic fee, but are bargains nevertheless. 

Among them are: 

Dun & Bradstreet and TRW business pro- files. 
Knowledge Index, a subset of Dialog con- taining more than 100 databases, including many major regional and national newspapers and many professional journals. The service, avail- able nights and weekends for a relatively mod- est $21 per hour, is a kind of "poor man's" Dialog. 
The Biography Research Center, providing access to the full range of Marquis Who's Who volumes and more. 
Magazines and newspapers. The Magazine Database searches 250 popular magazines; the Newspaper Archives accesses 55 daily newspa- pers. 

## Data brokers 

Private data brokers, who electronically com- pile public records from around the country, can be the mother lode for researchers wanting to find out everything about a prospect. 

One of the most popular data brokers is Database Technologies of Pompano Beach, Fla., which offers a service known as Autotrak. While DBT does not offer information as comprehen- sive as some of the others, the price is right: $1.50 per minute, with no sign-up or subscrip- tion fee. Other brokers, such as CDB Infotek or IRSC, can be more expensive and charge monthly access fees. But they offer more information, up to and including information gathered from state court systems. 

## How to begin 

On-line research will involve a learning curve. Plan on investing some time and money before you get proficient. Surf around for practice, starting with the list of sites in the accompany- ing article. 

Don't throw your books and other resources away. The on-line world is just one more tool researchers have at their disposal. It doesn't replace other sources, it supplements them. Use each as appropriate. 

Finally, remember that no single on-line re- source will provide everything there is to know about everybody and everything. Remember, too, that information gathered via modem is subject to the same sort of errors as information gathered on paper. Use what you find on-line as a road map, but verify everything. Most of all, just get out there and dig.

## On the Internet From page one: 

the folks who help charities and other nonprofits figure out how much potential donors can afford to give by checking out property records, stock prices, biographies, demographics - records equally useful to journalists. Here are a few sites maintained by some of the best in that profession that are worth check- ing out. 

The Internet Prospector, a terrific site main- tained by Randy Bunny at the University of Wyoming, with contributions from ace research- ers around the country. It includes tutorials: http://plains.uwyo.edu/~prospect 

The Prospect Research Page, maintained by the University of Washington's David Lamb: http://weber.u.washington.edu/~dlamb/ research.html

# Backgrounding 

Indices and search engines help researchers search huge chunks of the World Wide Web in one fell swoop. An index, such as Yahoo, is a collection of interesting Web sites assembled and maintained by human beings. A search engine, such as Altavista, scans every word on millions of Web pages and presents the addresses of pages meeting user- specified criteria. Always check out the "Help" links to learn how to refine and focus your searches. Yahoo: http:// www.yahoo.com Altavista: http:// www.altavista. digital.com 

addresses and phone numbers to the vehicles they drive. 

Yahoo People Search-http://www. yahoo.com/search/people/ 

An all-around good people locator, search- able by name or phone number, that can pro- vide postal and e-mail addresses. Other useful people locators are Switchboard (http:// www.switchboard.com) and Four11 (http:// www.four11.com). Clicking on the button marked "People" while on-line with Netscape's toolbar will bring up a page with a number of other useful people-finding sites. Another use- ful site is Who Where (http://www. whowhere.com), which combines people- business-finding links. 

The American Medical Association Phy- sician Locator - http://www.ama-assn.org/ 
Find physician addresses and credentials. From the AMA homepage, click on "AMA Health Insight" and then "Physician Select." 
Martindale-Hubbell Lawyer Locator http://www.martindale.com 

The on-line version of the well-thumbed, multi-volume lawyers directory. Find ad- dresses, phone numbers, professional creden- tials. Westlaw provides similar information through West's Legal Directory: http:// www.wld.com 

The Biography Research Center This section of CompuServe (GO BIOG- RAPHY), provides access to the full range of Marquis Who's Who volumes and additional similar works. Searches and downloads of full-text articles cost in the area of $5 each. 

## Data brokers 

acquired. 

Data brokers compile billions of public records on individuals, including information on addresses, former addresses, property, ve- hicles, professional licenses, neighbors, rela- tives, court records, and more. Financial records, access to which are restricted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, ordinarily are not available. The various data brokers have different offerings and different price struc- tures. Some require special software, others use standard communications software or are available via the Internet. When opening an account with a broker, make certain that all information offered is truly public and legally 

Three of the better known brokers are: 
CDB Infotek, Santa Ana, Calif.: (800) 427- 3747 
Database Technologies, Pompano Beach, Fla.: (800) 279-7710 
IRSC, Fullerton, Calif.: (800) 640-4772 Go on-line to do in-depth research on both publicly held and private businesses. 
Hoovers sOnline-http://www.hoovers.com Search a database of more than 10,000 profiles of companies, both public and private. Free searches provide basic information on compa- nies, with links to additional on-line sources. A $9.95 per month subscription enables access to more in-depth profiles. 
Dun & Bradstreet, TRW business profiles These profiles are a way to research thousands of businesses, including officer names, general business information, payment patterns, debts, liens, and judgments, etc. Most information is self-reported and must be considered in that con- text, but for privately-held companies, these sources often provide the best available informa- tion. Both are available on CompuServe. GO DUNS for D&B, GO TRW for TRW. Depending on the profile, prices range from about $30 to about $70. 
Security & Exchange Commission/EDGAR http://www.sec.gov 
The SEC" EDGAR database enables research- ers to search for all SEC documents from publicly traded companies that file electronically. There is a 24-hour delay between the time documents are filed and when they are available via EDGAR. Immediate access is available through private vendors, including EDGAR Online, http:// www.edgar-online.com, which charges $9.95 month. 
Stock kQuotes--http://www.stockmaster.com Many services provide on-line stock quotes, usually with a 15- 20-minute delay. Stockmaster is just one. 

## News

As the new year starts, we want to share news on the latest happenings at NICAR and Investigative Reporters & Editors. 

## New training director 

Sarah Cohen, recently of The St. Peters- burg Times, becomes NICAR's newest train- ing director. Sarah starts her new job this month and already is scheduled to travel to California and Pennsylvania. 

Sarah will be telecommuting from her home in Maryland, following the lead of the previous training director, Neil Reisner, who worked out of his New Jersey home. (Neil begins working at the Miami Herald late this month.) 

At The St. Petersburg Times, Sarah worked as a business reporter using computer-assisted reporting extensively. Before that she worked at the Tampa Tribune. 

Sarah switched to journalism in 1992 after working as an economist, primarily at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This means Sarah brings a wonderful amount of knowledge of numbers and stats to the job. We hope that Sarah will not only do training, but also will analyze some data for news organizations. 

Sarah a journalism master's degree from the University of Maryland's journalism school and a bachelor's degree in economics from University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, both schools at which NICAR has jointly done seminars. 

## NashCAR 

The schedule for panels at NashCAR, March 6-9, in Nashville, Tenn. (register through IRE, 573-882-2042 or on our Web site www.nicar.org/nashcar) is included in this is- sue. Panelists and instructors are being chosen as this is being written - look for them in the next issue of Uplink. As usual, we plan to cover a wide range of topics with some of the best CAR journalists in the country. Among the panelists and instructors will be CAR guru Philip Meyer, author of "The New Precision Journalism"; Shawn McIntosh, who heads CAR at the Dallas Morning News; training expert Jennifer LaFleur, now database editor at the San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News and NICAR's 

first training director; Paul Adrian of WBNS-TV in Columbus, Ohio; Neill Borowski of The Philadelphia (Pa.) Inquirer, David Milliron, head of CAR for Gannett News Service; Bill Casey of the Washington Post; Brad Goldstein of The St. Petersburg Times; Bob Port of Associated Press; Tom Gaumer of The Cleveland Plain Dealer, and a host of others from newspapers and TV stations, including some of the newer names in CAR. 

At this point, the computer situation in NashCAR looks awesome. We will rent some computers for the hotel, but Vanderbilt Univer- sity has generously loaned several computer labs containing about 140 computers with Internet connections for the conference. 

In addition to panels and three classes of hands-on training, we will have a mentor pro- gram in which you can get your worked critiqued, a demonstration room for software, the Internet and Intranets, a section for vendors and rooms for impromptu meetings and brainstorming. 

## IRE membership 

If you use NICAR services, then becoming an IRE member can save you or your news organi- zation more money than ever. Uplink will cost $40 for members, instead of $60 for nonmem- bers. Data from the database library will cost $10 more for nonmembers. Requests for articles from the IRE Resource Center - articles which often show you how to best use data from the database library - will cost more for nonmembers. If you become an IRE member you also will get the six issues of the IRE Journal free and numerous other IRE services. 

## Web activities 

Our Web site (homepage: www.reporter.org) continues to expand and improve. We hope to have new designs for our pages up and running in mid-February. Wallace Winfrey, our Web ad- ministrator, and other staff members are hard at working putting more handouts and other educa- tional material on the site. 

We also will have a demonstration soon of a clickable map where you can choose a state and get a list of investigative reporters in that state. We also are making better use of Lotus Notes and Microsoft's SQL server. More on this later. Brant Houston can be reached at (573) 882-

Car Trips: First ventures 

# Pushing the bridge limits 

## By Dave Sheingold 

Westchester Rockland News Dave Sheingold attended the NICAR bootcamp in July, 1996. 

It sounded like a no-brainer: 13-ton school buses crossing 3-, 4- and 5-ton bridges running over busy railroad tracks? Trucks weighing up to 40 tons specifically directed to cross an 11- ton bridge over the same railroad lines? Couldn't be? Could be. In fact, that - and other potential disasters - are just what Gannett Newspapers found in the northern New York City suburbs as part of a two-part series in November that stemmed from searches through a statewide database of bridge conditions. 

## Disaster in the making 

Among the possibilities for serious trouble found by the newspaper were these: 

Fully-loaded school buses, which weigh anywhere from 10 to 15 tons running every school day over at least six bridges with signs barring vehicles of more than 3, 4 or 5 tons. Most of them spanned busy commuter railroad lines running into and out of New York City. 
Large vehicles ranging from 6-ton delivery trucks to 15-ton fire trucks to 40-ton tractor- trailers using the same bridges as the buses. 
A sign posted by one village that directed industrial truck traffic such as cement mixers, tractor-trailers and garbage trucks weighing well over 20 tons when full over an 11-ton bridge. 

After the newspaper chain notified about 10 local busing and trucking companies, all vowed to immediately change their routes. But that didn't stop experts on bridge maintenance and construction from warning that the potential for crisis continued to loom across the state. 

The difficulties in dealing with the problem included the century-old age of some bridges, commercial traffic routes running over many of these spans, police manpower too limited to consistently enforce the weight limits and a professed lack of funds by a commuter railroad that owns many of the most endangered bridges. Some communities look the other way because they fear damaging local commerce. 

"Ican't say what the odds are. But there is the potential for something very nasty to happen," 

said Norbert Luft, a state bridge engineer with the New York Department of Transportation. 

## How the story began 

The story began with an idea to look at general bridge conditions contained in a com- plex ASCII, fixed-length database of about 100 heavily coded fields describing the latest bridge inspections and results, kept by the state trans- portation department. But the story quickly ex- panded to look at bridges with weight limits. 

Initially, about 50 of the fields in the database that related directly to conditions, traffic vol- ume, age, bridge lengths, weight limits and other elements were imported into a database manager using Paradox for DOS. We used a fixed-length importer called FLIMPORT that allowed us to pick and choose which fields we wanted to look at. (Excluded were many involv- ing things such as bridge heights, underpass clearances, construction materials and types of connections with the adjoining land embank- ments. They needlessly clogged up an already lengthy database and could have been imported at some point, if necessary.) 

At that point, we simply planned to do a single story looking at overall conditions in our coverage area (Westchester and Putnam coun- ties, pop. 960,000) and the entire state, looking at the owners and regions with the best and worst bridges. But we began to notice that many of the bridges popping up in the weight-limit field ran through commercial areas. We pulled them out, sorted them by community and weight limit, then camped out by 15 bridges for about a half-hour each. 

It took only a few minutes of observation at 11 of the bridges to see that the limits were routinely ignored. The other four were in lightly traveled areas. 

## Reactions 

The reactions to the findings were mixed. Nearby residents and merchants said the situ- ation had gone on for years and that they figured it was allowed. 

Meanwhile, school-bus officials in several communities, as well as businesses whose trucks were seen using the bridges, professed surprise and ignorance of the problem and immediately

Tech Tip 

# Use FoxPro to document a table 

NICAR now offers the NASA Air Safety Reporting System database. The price ranges from $40 to $60, depending on the size of your news organization. For more information, call NICAR at (573) 882-0684. 

## By Richard Mullins 

The Missouri School of Journalism I wouldn't want to work in a paperless office, let alone try to analyze data and report without any paper. I want electronic copies of everything so I don't have to retype anything, and I want paper copies of some things be- cause they're portable and usable in ways that the same stuff on a computer screen isn't. 

One of the paper essentials in computer- assisted reporting is the record layout, al- though some data comes with this information in an accompanying text file. However, after you have created a table in FoxPro, it is very easy to document its structure, add in the data dictionary and even include narrative explana- tions of fields and stuff, all in one single file. 

You can do this by creating a structure description table from the data table and add- ing fields and information to it. 

Here's how to do it. First, with the desired data table open, use this FoxPro command to create the structure table: 

copy structure extended to NewTable 

The table, NewTable, contains the follow- ing four fields. The command has converted the field names from the original table into a table of records like this: 

Field |Field_Len|Field Type|Field De 

"Field_name," obviously, lists the names 

of the fields from the original table. "Field_len" lists the length of the field as designated in the original. "Field_type" shows whether the con- tents for that field in the original table are charac- ter, numeric, etc. And "Field_dec" indicates deci- mals, where applicable. 

You also can add fields to NewTable to help further document the original table- just be sure to add fields to the end so the next step (see below) will work. The most useful field to add might be a description field of 30 or 40 charac- ters, since the 10-character field name limit in FoxPro can require dreaming up some very cryp- tic field names. Referring to this table or a print- out of it can help you decipher field names like ACNMEXPDAT. 

You can also create a memo field, which could hold a data or code dictionary and longer com- ments for the field. Be sure to add any supplemen- tal fields to the end of the field order. This keeps the structure table usable for the next step - creating a new table based on the structure table. 

This command is the reverse of the first com- mand you used. It creates a new table using the structure table as the specifications for field names, data types, etc.

Slips tell the story 

# Pawnshops draw criminals 

## By Scott Glover 

Fort Lauderdale (Fla.) Sun-Sentinel Fort Lauderdale has the third worst property crime rate in the nation and has more pawnshops than it does McDonald's. Is there a link? Police have been saying "yes" for years. We decided to check it out for ourselves. 

## Beat the clock 

In July, the Sun-Sentinel made a request under Florida's Sunshine Law for every pawn slip generated in the city in 1995. (Our request beat a change in state law in October that specifi- cally exempted the forms from public view.) 

There were nearly 70,000. About 32,000 had been entered into the police department's com- puter; another 38,000 had not. 

We hired temporary workers to enter the paper records into our own PCs. Then we merged the two databases and loaded them into the computer program Paradox. 

The result was a gold mine of information: the names, addresses and birth dates of everyone who had pawned anything in 1995. The slips, required to be filled out by pawnbrokers then sent to the police, also included detailed descrip- tions of the items pawned. 

## Criminal dealings? 

The first thing we did was rank the pawners by their number of trips to the pawnshop. Then we used local and state databases to check the criminal records of the top 50. 

The result: Thirty-nine out of 50 had criminal arrest records; 19 for burglary, theft or other related offense; 14 others faced drugs charges, almost all of them for cocaine. The remaining five faced a hodgepodge of charges. 

But we let the pawners' activities speak for themselves. 

Is something amiss when a 21-year-old con- victed burglar goes to the pawnshop 66 times in one year, pawning, among many other things, 12 bikes, 14 beepers, five car stereos four portable stereos, two VCRs and eight rings? 

What about a man with a laundry list of drug and theft charges on his rap sheet who went to the pawnshop 64 times in 1995, pawning seven TVs, eight VCRs, four portable stereos and two 

## home stereos? 

We let readers decide. Judging from the hundreds of calls, letters, faxes and e-mails that we - and more impor- tantly, state legislators received in response to our series, it seemed certain that readers were angry at what they had read. The state senator who sponsored anew law governing pawnshops has already filed a bill that will tighten restric- tions on the industry. 

## Banks for the poor 

Finding bad guys was not the only use for our database. We also wrote a story about frequent pawners who were not suspected of anything criminal, but were caught up in a cycle. That story, which included anecdotes about a man who made 153 trips to the pawnshop in a single year, focused on the role of pawnshops as "banks for the poor." 

As best we can tell, this project is unique. Nowhere, including in the IRE morgue and NICAR database library, could we find an in- vestigative story based on pawn slips. 

## Duplicating the project 

If you're interested in conducting an investi- gation similar to ours, step one is to determine whether pawn slips are kept in your city and, if so, whether they are public record. 

Since the document is little known, chances are reporters haven't asked to inspect them. Go in assuming you have the right to. We didn't know whether our request would be granted and were prepared to get the lawyers involved if it wasn't. One argument we would have made is that pawn slips are provided by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and by law are forwarded to local police departments, hence they are public. 

We don't know if that argument would have worked, but it's probably worth trying under similar circumstances. 

If your police department does keep pawn slips and agrees to turn them over, make sure to ask if they are available electronically. It' 11 save you a lot of work. Happy hunting. Scott Glover can be reached at (954) 356-4523.

said they would tell their drivers to re-route themselves. A county bus official said he be- lieved it was all right to run 15-ton buses over 10- and 11-ton bridges, but later changed his mind after a state bridge official strongly sug- gested otherwise. 

However, the traffic coordinator for the village of Mamaroneck said it was unlikely that a sign directing truck traffic over an 11-ton span would be changed because that was the easiest route out of the village for large ve- 

hicles. And the village administrator in Irvington said local police were unlikely to enforce limits on a 15-ton span because it was the only connec- tion to one busy industrial strip. Amid those conflicting responses, it was clear the problem would not be resolved any time soon. A follow-up story is planned in a few months to see what, if any, changes are really made.

After our issue on Freedom of Information battles, Joe Carroll of the Hammond (Ind.) Times shared this story: 

The criminal court clerk in a nearby city refused to let me look at a court file for a woman jailed on battery and resisting arrest charges. I offered the name of the defendant and cause number. 

"You'll need the judge's permission to see that." I said, "No Idon't, but even if I did, how do I find out who the judge is without looking at the file?" 

"Well, you' Il need one of the attorney's permission." When Iraised the same objection, I was told they couldn't find the file because they do not file cases according to name or cause number. They file them according to the defendant's next scheduled court date. 

"Again, how do I find that out without looking at the file? And since this defendant has already been sentenced to jail time, I doubt there IS another court date in store for her." 

The court clerk said she is, by law, the Keeper of Records, not the Distributor of Records. I was once again referred to the unnamed and unknowable judge. 

Needless to say, Indiana's Open Records Law makes no provision for such denials, even if by officeholders who give themselves spooky titles like Keeper or Records. Eventually, it took a brief lawsuit to straighten them out.
